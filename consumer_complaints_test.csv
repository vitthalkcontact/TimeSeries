A man named XXXX reached out to me in 2018 and at that time the amount he wanted me to pay was already more than double what I owed to the hospital. I questioned the amount, asked for explanations from their company, and asked for confirmation of the specific amount the hospital was saying I owed as I was willing to work out something to pay what I actually owed, and he was incredibly rude and aggressive. He was unwilling to work with me would not accept a payment for the amount owed, and made threats about ruining my credit. I did not speak with him or anyone in the company again because I felt very uncomfortable talking to them. Since then, I've received nothing from the company in regards to this debt and they just continue to increase the amount. My last statement from the hospital was that I had owed them {$1700.00} and the collection agency is reporting that I owe almost {$10000.00}",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Voss & Klein, LLC",FL,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/14/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3795719

I called in to settle an account and they started talking to me about someones elses debt and told me the amount they owe, with USING THE DEBTEES NAME! This is a MAJOR violation according to the Federal Trade Commissions Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692d, 805 ( b ) Communications with Third Parties. 

I asked to speak with the Supervisor and his remarks were So what! This doesnt effect you, I told him that it is a violation of the Debtee and it causes me to have concern on their integrity and how they do business. He said everyone makes mistakes, and I agreed, however this violated Federal Law. He was very argumentative and kept saying what a you going to do about it?, I said I will take it further since he doesnt understand the magnitude of it. 

I then asked to go back to my issue and pay our mutually agreed upon amount to close my case. He gave me an amount of the original amount. I told him that was not it and that is was a different amount. He kept repeating that amount ( 6 times total ). I finally had to tell him to look at the notes in my file!!! He finally found it and admitted he was wrong. I kept telling him that I wanted to pay it but he insisted on going down a rabbit trail. He started asking me Dont I have a problem with him not looking at the notes first?, I said yes and it causes even more concern about his company. I told I want to pay my bill. He started saying that he is surprised I didnt want to complain about that. I said that I want to pay what I owe if he would stop acting like an XXXX XXXX . He  said the call was over and hung up. I admit that I should not have used the word XXXX XXXX , but I was taken to my limit. I have sent an email to just get my agreed upon amount settled.

08/14/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I have two transactions, both of which occurred on XX/XX/2020 and neither of which were authorized. XXXXne was for {$100.00} and another for {$50.00}. 

On the XXXX, my husband received a text from Santander Fraud asking if we made the {$50.00} charge, to which he replied NO. A fraud advisor called him and he disputed the charge, along with the {$100.00} XXXX XXXX charge. This is a joint account and neither I nor my husband made these purchases/transfers ( one was through XXXX - processed in Texas - we live in XXXX. and another through XXXX XXXX - an app which neither of us have ). We were given temporary credit for both of them, in compliance with Reg. E on the XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX via a form letter that an investigation was performed and they stated that the merchant is correct and they are denying my claim. ( Two letters, stating the same result for both charges ). 

Additionally, the form letter states that the dispute opening date was XX/XX/XXXX, but it was on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not given written confirmation of my error within 10 business days and was not informed within 3 business days. The document they sent has incorrect dates to show they are in compliance, but they are not. I am attaching the cell phone text received on the XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number on the form letter ( XXXX ) and after waiting on hold for 31 minutes, talked to a gentleman named XXXX. I asked for a copy of the support they utilized in making this determination, as listed on the letter. He stated he put the request in to their Fraud Department ( evidently he was just the Card Claims ) and I should receive the documents, via paper mail, within 3-5 days.  It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have not received anything. My guess is because there is no documentation, because the charges are fraudulent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, both charges were put back on my account. 

Additionally, during this time - though I don't have exact dates, I was issued a new debit card when I hadn't requested one. My card was not expiring and I was given no information as to why it was necessary. 

When I researched the description of the charges online, the XXXX one clearly shows that this is known fraud. And I just do not know the other charge, taken on the same day, most likely by whomever stole my information. 

Santander has never asked me if I want to close my account and open a new one, even when I called to state this was fraud. And now they are saying these charges are valid and they ARE NOT. This is our joint account for our mortgage. Review the account activity, it doesn't fit. We will certify via anything you offer that these charges are not authorized and are fraudulent. 

Santander is proving to be less than helpful and at this point, I'm concerned about my financial information being out in the dark web.

Our mortgage is usually {$1300.00}. The extra {$300.00} was a one time payment to cover escrow costs. The company accidentally withdrew two payments. One for {$1600.00} on the XXXX of XXXX, and an additional {$1300.00} on the XXXX. This overdrew our bank account. After calling freedom mortgage, a representative told us they were sorry for the mistake, and that the funds would be available next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). After discovering our account was still negative, we called and spoke to another representative. That representative reviewed the notes and told us the first representative said to send in a bank statement before they could process the refund. We were never told that. After speaking with the second representative, we sent the statement into Freedom Mortgage. The company acknowledged receiving our bank statements and the refund would be sent within three days. After three days, we called and spoke with another representative that told us the refund would be sent to us on the XXXX of XXXX. We called back today and now were being told the XXXX. 
Were usually very easy going customers. I understand that everyone, even large companies must try to adapt to the current situation. However, there appears to be no personal accountability with the company. Our bank account has been negative for 8 days. Weve received numerous overdraft fees. This has definitely been a difficult week, and were left trying to figure out how to get caught up again financially after all of this. I want to be clear in stating, that the representatives weve spoken to in the passed two days have tried everything they can to help. Unfortunately their hands appeared to be tied.

my intension on XX/XX/XXXX was to change this arrangement to my checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. .Banker at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX processed the required paperwork the he presented to me for this request. Last week I contacted the BB & T consumer loan dept. to find out about the status of my new instruction on this loan payment I was told that as of XX/XX/XXXX they have NOT received any forms from me or the banker that has processed my request at the local branch. Immediately again I contacted XXXX office branch and spoke to the same banker that had processed my original request and was told by him after his research on status of the form that the form is LOST and the fax DID NOT go through be their system.!

This action by the bank is very upsetting to me and my wife. As I indicated before Myself and my wife have been a long term customer of this bank and in a very GOOD STADING Status. I recently paid off my mortgage with them. Never wrote a bad check or violated any condition that may cause this action by the bank. No reason was given on their action.

Because I have had so many problems paying this way, I thought I would attempt to set up an ACH payment using their website. According to their site, I could not set it up ( error message ), so I went back to my banking site and set up a new auto payment coming from XXXX ( with the corrected loan number ). Well, apparently, they got my routing number and account number during my attempt to set up on their site and they pulled the funds from my account on XXXX. XXXX sent a check for my mortgage on XX/XX/30. So now they have 2 payments for my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment.

I bought used XXXX XXXX of XXXX. I had been a diligent payer until the Pandemic situation took place in the US, accordingly, I lost my job and all my income. I wasnt able to make a full monthly payment to the WestLake company. I tried to arrange my payment with this company, calling them virtually every day and begging them for help. However, it wasnt successful, they told me that they can not help me with this and I would have to make a full payment, no matter what. I couldnt find money to pay the car, so then they come to my house at night and towed my car with all my personal things in. 
I didnt even get any notice from WestLake that my car was going to be towed. I didnt know what to think, even called the police assuming that the car got stolen. WestLake reaches out to me in few days demanding a double monthly payment plus towing expenses and fees, saying they wont return a car otherwise. The also reported credit agencies, which damaged my credit score. The sum was prohibitive.. I asked my friend to lend me money to buy back my car as I was left without any transportation. As of now, WestLake imposed repossession expenses, late charges, NSF fees on my account. I asked them many times to work with me in this regard, and at least, take the fees off my account. They dont take into account that I have no job, no income, simply, they dont care.

07/25/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"My wife and I rented a car from XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX 2020 for 1 day. The representative at the counter told us we should take pictures of the car before renting because there were several customers disputing extra charges that the owner claimed were for damage to his cars. Our car was probably 10+ years old, with a lot of dents and scratches all over the car, as can be seen in the photos. When we returned the car, no one was at the office so we called and the owner said take the car back to our hotel and the rep would come pick the car up. 3 hours later she came and got the car. An hour after that she called and said the owner ( who was out of town ) said the car had a scratch on it ( how did he know this? ). She drove the car back to our hotel and showed us a white mark on a place on the car that somehow neither she nor we had captured in our photos. We took a photo of the white mark ( image # XXXX ). 
He never contacted us again regarding this issue. A month later I contacted Citi because the {$500.00} deposit had not been refunded, and called XXXX, the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He said "" You scratched my car! '' I asked whether he had any intention of contacting us or was he just thinking he'd keep the deposit with no communication to us, and that we did not scratch his car. He ended up screaming at me and hanging up on me ; at which point I wrote an email to him, and contacted Citi. Citi told me to cancel the card and start the dispute process, and gave me the direct phone number to the Dispute department ( XXXX ) and the disput ID # XXXX XXXX. Please see the attached email chain between XXXX and myself - there is more information on our experience with his rep and himself. Basically I wrote that a ) we did n't drive near anything that would have made at "" scratch '' in that area of the car, b ) the car had scratches and dents all over car, none of which had been repaired, c ) the representative picked up the car from us and drove the 3 miles back to the rental office, the 3 miles back to our hotel, and d ) the contract declared normal wear and tear being included in the rental price and that the scratch was barely visible compared to all of the other damage to the car. He replied by asking for my credit card information! 
To my mind this is ridiculous that he even tried to charge us - the "" damage '' was probably there when we rented the car, or the rep might have done it on the way back when she had possession of the car ; there is absolutely no way that we could be deemed responsible and charged for this. 

There are 20 photos in all, with # XXXX being the one my partner took when the rep drove the car the 3 miles back to our hotel to show us the "" damage '' he was claiming we did. Again, he wasn't even in the locality, and we never spoke to him, only through the rep. He never supplied an invoice or bill for the extra charges. 

I contacted CitiI contacted Citi a month after submitting the dispute. I spoke to "" XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm, who told me there was "" no direct phone number for billing disputes, but she could connect me '' ; I was hold for 25 minutes then was disconnected. I called the Dispute line again and spoke to "" XXXX '' who had no idea what XXXX had been talking about re the Dispute phone number. She told me the dispute had been filed in the wrong department and would be re-filed. I then sent the ( attached below ) files, emails, photos, and statements clearly outlining the events on XX/XX/XXXX2020. I received an email form Citi on XX/XX/XXXX thanking me for sending the dispute details, and that they would be in touch if any other information was needed for their investigation. 
I received a letter for Citi on XX/XX/XXXX stating "" the case had been decided and the payment was being awarded back to XXXX XXXX XXXX Rentals, with no further explanation. I called Citi on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to "" XXXX '' at XXXX XXXX. She told me Citi hadn't looked at any of the evidence, that if a merchant "" disputes the dispute then it is automatically reversed back to them, and I could appeal the decision by sending in the supplied letter signed and dated ''. EXPRESSLY stated in that letter was to NOT send any documents with the letter, but to send all my documents separately. I asked XXXX why they didn't even look at what I'd sent before making a decision, and why I'd need to re-send documents to the same address I had already sent them to. She put me on hold to speak to a supervisor and came back saying she could "" open the documents and see everything, and I did NOT need to re-send anything ''. She told me Citi would be in touch with me if they needed any more information for their investigation. I received an email form Citi on XX/XX/XXXX thanking me again for my submission of the dispute details. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter form Citi stating "" We received your response ; however, the letter is only signed and dated. Since the letter you returned is incomplete as a result, we have no further means to assist you in this dispute ... we now consider this investigation complete '', and I owe the amount fraudulently charged by XXXX XXXX XXXX to Citi. 
The word "" incompetent '' describes for me the entire response of several departments and representatives of Citi. The obvious facts and evidence regarding this fraud that I sent to Citi was never even looked at. XXXX XXXX Rentals never supplied an invoice or receipt or any other communications defending their keeping of my deposit. The pictures of the car show multiple scratches and dents all over the car that had never been repaired. The employee working there told us to take pictures of the entire car because several other renters were disputing what they said were false charges the owner was attempting to charge for damages!

I immediately contacted the Law Office of Aldridge Pite LLP. I spoke to the paralegal assigned, MS. XXXX XXXX, to the case and advised that according to my fathers will, I was disowned. I offered a copy of the will and asked that I be removed as a party to the lawsuit. I emailed that will to Ms. XXXX on that same day. Ms. XXXX advised me that she had already spoken to my sister XXXX and would be emailing us a document to sign dismissing my name from the action. She asked that I send her a copy of the will. I also informed her that my brother XXXX XXXX was adopted by my step-father when he was XXXX years old. He was also not a legal heir. According to the will, the only legal heir is XXXX XXXX. 

I never got the email. My sister XXXX however did. I thought that since the statute of limitations to contest the will had expired on the XXXX of XXXX, that the reason I did not get that email was because I provided a copy of the will. I thought nothing of it and didn't even discuss it with my sister. Shortly after that, Covid caused the lock down in my state and Oregon, I did not even consider that I might need to appear in court. I was also not notified that there was a change in attorney 's handling the case, which would have clued me in that I was still on the list of defendants. 

On or about the XXXX week of XXXX, I received a copy of the judgement against me for the default and foreclosure of my fathers house. Not only am I not a legal heir, I was never on the title or the loan. I did not discover that my sister had received the email, and I did not, until I spoke with XXXX after receiving the judgement documents.

On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter, dated XX/XX/2020, from XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President of Wells Fargo Mortgage Company. In this letter Wells Fargo noted that I deferred 3 mortgage payments when I entered into the forebearance program in XX/XX/2020. In fact when I entered into that program via a phone call with Wells Fargo I was told that I had already made my XX/XX/2020 mortgage payment and that I would only be able to defer two months mortgage payments, XXXX and XX/XX/2020. 

On XX/XX/2020, I telephonically contacted Wells Fargo and spoke with a female employee ( unknown ) to restart my bi-weekly payments so that my mortgage payment for XX/XX/2020 would be satisfied. During that and a subsequent conversation a day or two later this employee told me that the bi-weekly payments would start on XX/XX/2020 and that the bank would make the withdrawals from my checking account every two weeks moving forward, with the next withdrawal from my checking account being made on XX/XX/2020. During this conversation I questioned this employee as to whether the withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX would insure that my mortgage payment due on XX/XX/2020 would be satisfied. This employee assured me that the second bi-weekly payment on XX/XX/2020 was within the allowed grace period and that once the bank received this payment they would credit my mortgage account for XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2020, I telephonically contacted XXXX XXXX who subsequently contradicted what the other Wells Fargo employee told me. XXXX XXXX told me that the monies that I paid on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2020 were not applied to my XXXX mortgage payment but were applied to my mortgage payment due XX/XX/2020. Ms. XXXX indicated that the investor ( XXXX XXXX ) would not allow the second payment/withdrawal from my checking account be applied to my XXXX payment since it had not been made by XX/XX/2020. 

According to Ms. XXXX, I am ahead in my payments on my mortgage since the next withdrawal from my checking account will be made on XX/XX/2020 which will be applied to my XXXX payment. 

During this conversation I told MsXXXX XXXX that I wanted Wells Fargo to correct their mistake and apply the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments to my mortgage payment due on XX/XX/2020 as they had indicated during my phone conversation with a bank employee on or around XX/XX/2020.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,PA,194XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3772919

I deposited a check from an insurance company. The check was more than 90 days old and therefore not honored. I have plenty of money in my account, {$2300.00} today, after the check for {$1700.00} was taken back out since it was not honored. I could not access my account last week on line. I tried to reset my password and could not. I reached out to the bank 800 number as instructed on their site and was told that the account was frozen for suspected fraud. I was told I had to contact the local branch to get it unfrozen that the local branch was the only way to unfreeze it. I was given the contact phone number. I called and spoke to a woman who took my info and explained that the manager was not, but that she would try to get someone else to help. I heard nothing. I called on Tuesday and spoke to XXXX XXXX who told me to call the 800 number. He said that the local branch can not freeze accounts and he didnt know why I was told that. I explained that I did not want to talk to the 800 number because I had done that yesterday and they told me to contact the local branch. He then asked for my account number and told me that is was frozen for fraud. He said he needed the Insurance Agent to contact him to tell him that the check was for a claim, the amount, and the payee. I explained that he already had the check and questioned why, since the funds were already taken out. He would not waiver form the request to hear from the insurance agent. I thought the check was a homeowners claim since it was in a homeowners insurance file. I later found that is was a windshield claim from XX/XX/2019 for my sons car that we no longer have and dont even have that insurance anymore. I found the agent and she contacted XXXX XXXX. He refused to unfreeze my account still. He told the agent, XXXX XXXX, that he needed her to tell him the check number. She explained that she represents several companies as an insurance agent and that while she could confirm the claim date, payee, amount that she didnt issue the check. XXXX asked her to contact the company she represents and confirm the check number. This is excessive. I am not trying to get access to the {$1700.00} funds. They already went in and back out. I need access to my frozen account. I called the 800 number again today, XXXX. I explained the situation, I was transferred to a supervisor. Both told me that only the branch can unfreeze the account. I waited while they called the branch and was told that the manager is out today. I asked for the manager 's manager name. The 800 number refused to provide it. She claimed that she didnt have access to that. I doubted that. I asked her to ask the branch personnel. she put me on hold, supposedly called the branch, then came back on and said that the Assistant Manager would be calling me today. She said they wouldnt tell her the manager 's manager name. I asked how to file a complaint with the president 's office at Regions. The 800 number person told me to go on line. I explained that I can not do that since my account is frozen. I asked for the presidential complaint email and was told that there isnt one. I protested, explaining that I work at a bank and that there is one. She said no. She said I could email XXXX I told her that wanst the presidents 's office. She said it was. I told her I would file a complaint with CFPB instead. No response.

08/04/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Hello CFPB - I am having an issue with US Bank regarding my checking account I hope you can help me rectify. The issue I am having has to do with several overdraft fees of {$36.00} a piece which US Bank has charged me even though my account has seamlessly stayed in a positive standing. There is a total of 4 fees at {$36.00} a piece that I am concerned of and I contacted the bank manager of US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX in XXXX Arizona In regards to this matter on XX/XX/2020. I explained to him how my online banking shows proof of my account never falling into delinquent status and that I dont see how I should have been charged these fees. 3 of the fees in question were charged to my account on XX/XX/2020 because manager states the 3 charges prior to that made my account fall into a negative status. The 4th fee in question was charged on 5/6/2020 because the charge before that allegedly made my account fall Into negative status. I informed the manager that my online banking account does not indicate what he is saying is true. My online account shows my balance before and after the charges In question and that my account was always in good standing. XXXX asked me if I could screen shot my online banking account statement and email it to him and that is what I did. He looked at my checking account statement from my online banking I sent him and he told me that there were discrepancies from what my online banking account balances were showing and the balances that US Bank had on their end. I asked him how could that be possible? He told me he was not sure and he would look into the matter and get back to me the following day. The next day XX/XX/2020 around XXXX XXXX  I had not heard back from XXXX so I decided to give him a call. When he called me back shortly after that he aggressively told me that what my online account balance states is basically irrelevant and their statements Indicate I went overdrawn on my account and all the fees will stand. 

I really hope you can help me get through this situation with US Bank please. I feel like I am being take advantage of and i am a victim of fraud. I am happy to provide me online statements for you and anything else you might need so you can see what is being done. 
If what US Bank shows on their end indicates my account fell Into a negative status then this means that US Bank is showing me a faulty balance and keeping a different balance only they can see behind the scenes which would allow me to unknowingly fall into negative status while allowing me to think I am in a positive status. Either situation that is happening is fraudulent and they should not be able to manipulate money out of customers like this, especially In a stressful time which is what we are going through right now. 

Thank you for taking time to hear my problem and I hope to hear back from you soon. Please let me know any documents I can provide you.

07/25/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"At approximately the beginning of XXXX, I reached out to US Bank to refinance my home mortgage. Because the interest rates had dropped, I thought that this would be a good time and I could lock in a 20 year loan for the same amount as my 30 year loan. I began the process with them immediately. By XX/XX/XXXX, I'd received some follow up communication, which implied the appraisal had come through. I sent them an email on XX/XX/XXXX because I wanted to see the appraisal. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email that I could view the appraisal, which I did. On XXXX, I sent an email asking if their refinance would be processed in enough time for me to keep the rate they had locked me in at when I applied. On XXXX, they told me my loan was still with underwriting in the initial review. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was asked for additional information, which prompted me to send two emails and to make a phone call. I finally spoke to my loan officer and asked about an amount of money they were wanting statements for, why I couldn't get ahold of anyone, and what was going on with my HOA ( my HOA requires a fee for a refinance which the loan officer was not aware of and even argued that it wasn't normal for them to do that, but I've refinanced on this home before so I am 100 % certain it's required ). The loan officer FINALLY increased the loan amount on XX/XX/XXXX ( had asked her on XXXX ) so I wouldn't have to pay cash at closing. On XXXX, I was told they had emailed my insurance company to switch the information over to US Bank. The processor implied that my insurance company was making them wait. I've worked with the insurance company for over seven years and they are extremely efficient so I knew it wasn't them holding this process up! On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the loan officer asking if this refinance is going to be finished before my XXXX mortgage payment is due. That we are now on THREE months for a refinance. THREE MONTHS! I have bought 4 homes and refinanced this one before so a total of 5 closing experiences not counting this one. In all of those times, not once did the process take over a month. I honestly want out of the refinance at this point but they've already charged me their fee and with their lackadaisical approach, I'm sure there are papers floating around everywhere half finished. If it takes 3 months to do the paperwork, I have no doubts that something will be wrong. The processor already spelled my name wrong and I had to correct her on that. That is literally her only job.

I completed 2 disputes with Regions bank In hopes of being refunded my money and was denied each time.

07/27/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"As a first time home-buyer, I purchased a house, about 15 years ago, that I was renting. As a young single mother, I was unaware of the home buying process and was a great target for a predatory loan. All of the purchasing processes were handled by the homeowner. She was a realtor and she assured me that the company she was using was one she had used in the past.

The original lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was a variable mortgage, whereas the interest was not suppose to exceed 6 %. Since then the mortgage was sold to another company, Select Portfolio Servicing, and the interest rate has exceeded the 6 %. I have attempted to pay more towards my principal and specifically instructed the funds to go to my principal. When I received my statement, the funds were applied to some erroneous late fees that XXXX XXXX XXXX stated were owed before the mortgage was sold to SPS. In reviewing my 1098 from SPS, I was appalled to see that I have paid {$4400.00} to interest and {$810.00} to principal. In addition, I received a 1098 from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating I, also, paid interest to them in 2019 ( {$750.00} ).XXXXI believe this sort of loan and practice should be reviewed and reversed as it has robbed me, and others like me, the real opportunity of ever actually owning a home. I have struggled over these 15 years to pay my mortgage believing I was moving closer to actually owning it and passing it down to my children.

The nature of my complaint involved a very aggressive debt collector named "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' whom bought two accounts, for the purpose of this compliant it will be specifically about my XXXX XXXX account. However a second complaint will be filed with regards to my other account with them. 

In 2017 I started working with a local automotive parts manufacture here in town called XXXX while I was enrolled in college full time. This job really left me in financial ruin, as slowly my wages were not being paid to me. Sadly, the fact that I was left without wages and the owner would string me along and promise to pay me "" next week, next month '' etc, I continued to work without pay expecting to eventually receive my wages. 

Because I was not getting paid, my credit cards and other bills went into default. One of those is this debt XXXX XXXX bought from Citibank. I have been engaged in a 2 year legal battle with XXXX and it's owners. I have a case with the California Department of Labor and have had multiple hearings and a trial where I was  awarded by the court my past due wages. I have attached the court declarations and the complaint against XXXX, so you can read first hand the nightmare I've been through. I even lost my dear Dog because I was unable to pay his continued veterinary treatment. 

However this judgement awarding me my past due wages has been impossible to collect, and even though I have a court order for CALMINI to pay me, I have not received any monies and the situation looks extremely unlikely I will see a XXXX out of this due to the company being now investigated by the Local District Attorney 's office, and they have an F rating on the XXXX so they have zero chance of actually getting new clients. I am attaching the proof of the D.A investigation and a copy of the XXXX profile so you can see. 

I have implored midland to really help me with this, but instead they just transfer me to there "" legal department '' like i'm supposed to be some kind of criminal. I hope once they see the proof of my terrible situation they will be more willing to work with me. I do not appreciate them making legal threats against me, when I'm simply just trying to resolve my account. they are impossible to negotiate with and I just hope these facts helps them help me pay this off at a reduced amount, and stop threatening me with legal action when I am not refusing to pay.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,933XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3788544

I opened an account at Citibank. Then I lost my phone and changed the number with the Citibank. A couple of days later I initiated a wire for XXXX $ ( XX/XX/XXXX ), they called me in order to confirm the wire and asked me security questions which I answered. Moreover, I called Citibank before sending the wire so they won't cancel it or block my account. However, they canceled the wire and blocked the account. The reason they gave me was that they can't verify my name to the number I calling them from ( the new number I got at XXXX XXXX XXXX ), they probably forgot that I answered security questions. At first, they said that the phone verification process will take from 24 to 48 hours. I called them in 72 hours ( XX/XX/XXXX, my birthday day ), nothing changed. They asked me to call them on my mother 's phone number, then from my brother 's phone number. I did both, however, the account is still locked ( approximately for 4 days already, meaning that I can not use my card or receive/send money ). Because of that, I am unable to pay my bills, credit cards, phone bills, buy food, receive my XXXX payments, etc. Bank representatives over the phone kept screaming on me, hanging up and kept transferring me from one department to another one without even asking me. They promised to call me back around 4 times, I haven't received a single phone call from them. I am spending around 5-6 hours on a phone daily because of them. It is like a nightmare, every department gives different information, I would even say the opposite information. So a couple of the representatives told me that the bank will contact XXXX  XXXX XXXX to verify the phone number to my name in 24 to 48 hours, however, it has already been more than 10 days and they keep giving me different information in every department and the account is still locked. They also told me to call XXXX XXXX XXXX where the representative told me that Citibank is just giving me headaches because the new phone number is registered under my name and even the callerID is under my name. Moreover, I use this new phone number with the XXXX, XXXX and listed as my contact information on my XXXX. I can not come to the branch because I have XXXX, so one of the representatives told me that I can notarize a power of attorney on my brother 's name and that he can unlock the account with two photo ID 's of me and POA. He came into the branch where the bank manager asked me to call the Citibank fraud department. I did call them again and heard a new version of how should unblock my account and they also told me that the POA won't help here. The only solution they gave me is to call them from the old phone number which is already taken by another person. Are they asking me to commit a crime? So how can I unblock my account? How are they allowed to block my account for such a long time? Who will compensate me for financial and legal losses caused by the team of the Citibank? Why are they kipping my money? I am not criminal, however, the bank is treating me like one and can not provide me the information about what I have to do to get my number in their "" database '' where it does not associate with my name? Why the bank can not call the XXXX XXXX XXXX and verify the information for more than 10 days? Why they are not giving me the options to solve the problem? Seems like representatives over the phone have no clue on what is happening, what are the protocols and how they can verify a phone number to a name? There are many reviews on the web with the same issue people are having with the Citibank. The institution is doing illegal things and using people 's money. The only explanation I have to justify their actions. I am having an actual XXXX XXXX I am XXXX. How can I solve this?

08/06/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"I received a personal check in the amount of {$100.00} as a birthday gift. I deposited the check into my M & T checking account via ATM on XX/XX/20. A few days later I received a letter dated XX/XX/20 that stated, Dear customer, your account xxxxxxxx has been charged for the total value of the of the following items which were deposited and subsequently returned for the reasons below. Please note that any service charges incurred are listed above for your reference. If you have any questions please contact your relationship manager or call XXXX at the phone number listed above. 

This showed that the check I had deposited was rejected. They included a legal copy of the check, which was hard to distinguish from a regular paper copy. After looking it all over I saw that M & T had cut off the last digit of the routing number on the check on their end, even though the routing number was clearly visible on the check and the legal copy. My account was also charged with a {$10.00} service fee I figured that this was an issue with the scanner they put the checks through. On XX/XX/20 I called the XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX number for the XXXX to hopefully clear this up over the phone. I was on hold waiting to speak to a representative for 45 minutes before I decided to not waste anymore time and I hung up. 

I called again the next day XX/XX/20 and this time I was on hold for 25 minutes before I was able to speak to a representative ( whos name I do not know ). I explained my situation to her hoping for a quick resolution over the phone by fixing the missing digit on the routing number so the check could be deposited. Her first words to me were Soooooo .... what do you wan na do?? It was in such a way, as if there is nothing she can do for me, or its not her job. I said I want the check deposited into my account and I want the {$10.00} service fee removed. She says Sir, I am going to put you on hold. 

Irritated at this point I told her no, thats not acceptable. 25 minutes of waiting to get ahold of someone, speaking for 2 minutes and then immediately back on hold with no explanation? 
She said she needed a manger and apologized, then put me on hold for 25 more minutes. When she returned, she explained that my best course of action was to go to a branch and re deposit the legal copy of the check that was sent back to me. She recommended I set up mobile banking, which I have, but am locked out of and have never been able to get assistance with. She also removed the {$10.00} service fee, but that was the only help I received after the 55 minute long phone call. 

Unhappy with the idea of needing to see a teller in person for what should be a simple fix, I called a local M & T branch. A woman ( whos name I do not know ) answered quickly and I again explained the situation. She was much friendlier, but she too stated that I would need to come to a branch so they could manually enter the numbers on the bottom of the check to avoid this from happening again. 

On XX/XX/20 I went to a local branch ( I am 25 minutes from the closet branch, so I try to do business on my way home from work ) and explained the whole situation to the teller. She looked confused, as the check copy hardly looks like a check that can be deposited. The teller brought over another employee who appeared to be a manager, and assured the teller that the check can be deposited. I asked that the numbers be entered manually, the manager agreed and instructed the teller to do so. She printed a receipt that showed the deposit and I left assuming that this has been taken care of. 

XX/XX/20 I get a letter from M & T. It is the exact same letter as before. It is dated XX/XX/20 and shows my deposit on XX/XX/20, reason for return, {$10.00} service fee, same routing number error. This time they sent a copy, of the copy of the original check. I am now furious over what this has now become. I now proceed to call the local branch, since the 1800 number is useless for quick responses. 

This time I am speaking to XXXX. I explain a condensed version of this entire situation to her. The response I received from her was that I should take the check to the bank it was drawn on ( XXXX  ), and cash it there. I was blown away. I could not believe they would just give up, and not fix this. I told her how this was at no fault of my own, and this was M & Ts responsibility to make it right. She blamed the check design on XXXX  checks for the error, and offered nothing. I received only excuses. How could it be the check design when the checks work at all other locations except M & T? She stated that she would file a complaint for me, call XXXX to see what is going on with their checks, look into their own check scanners, and call me back. She did remove the {$10.00} service fee XX/XX/20 Extremely unhappy with how all of this is going, and without receiving a callback from XXXX for 48 hours I enter a local XXXX  XXXX branch with the copy of the copy of the original check. I briefly explain the situation, asking to just cash this thing and be done with it. The teller calls a manger over and the manager looks at the check. She states that she can not cash this because it is a copy of a copy. At this point I have no clue what I am supposed to do. The manager from XXXX   made a copy, of the copy of the copy of the check and started making phone calls to her colleagues to see what could be done. 

I walk outside and call XXXX from M & T. The tone in her voice sank an octave when she realized it was me. She tried telling me that she was still looking into, was going to call back, its all XXXX fault, etc ... I wasnt having it. I demanded that she fund my account with the {$100.00}. She deflects, and again for some reason keeps blaming XXXX  for the routing number mix up, even though it was clearly their check reader/incompetence entering numbers. At this point I do not care. I want the {$100.00}, and maybe some other compensation for all of this grief. 

With XXXX on the phone, I place my phone on the managers desk at XXXX, on speakerphone to let these two  hash things out. XXXX  manger requests either the original, or original copy of the original check. XXXX states she would need to look into this. She has no idea where it could be at this point. XXXX  manager states she will keep working on her end to get permission to cash the copy of the copy. I leave XXXX. 

XX/XX/20 I receive a call at XXXX XXXX from XXXX  manger  stating that I can bring the copy of the copy to the branch and they will cash it. They will negotiate the check. At XXXX XXXX I receive a call from XXXX, asking if I had heard back from XXXX. Still stunned that M & T could not resolve this, I told her they had called earlier, and that I will cash the check at XXXX  now that permission has been granted. She then apologies, states that this should have never gone this far and complaint has been filed. 

I still need to cash this copy of a copy, so the saga may  not be over. But the incompetence of M & T, and reluctance to help is stunning, along with their poor customer service and extremely long wait times on their help line. XXXX  had a resolution in a matter of hours. M & Ts solution was to send me to another institution to fix what they had erred. At least they removed the two separate {$10.00} service fees.

07/31/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I initiated a simple refinance with Citibank on XX/XX/20, after several delays on Citibank 's part they collected an application fee of nearly {$900.00} from me on XX/XX/20. 

My refinance is a very simple coventional loan, my wife and I have credit scores that average 800, an LTV of 41 %, and we provided Citibank current tax returns, W2s, paystubs, etc. We promptly provided Citibank everything they asked for. 

It has now been nearly FIVE months since I started my simple refi process with Citibank. Citibank refuses to provide me with any credible closing date and has continually lied about the progression of my application. As of today 's date ( XX/XX/20 ), my application is still "" in process '' with no end in sight. Citibank has also blatantly ignored my simple requests to escalate the issue. 

I've had multiple friends start and complete their refinance applications with other lenders in 3-4 weeks time, all during the same period that Citibank has held my application hostage.

Neither my loan officer nor her manager have been very helpful, they only provide canned responses such "" very soon '' and "" only two more weeks. '' They've been feeding me those lines for months. 

Citibank 's conduct has to be criminal. How can Citibank be allowed to collect money from customers and then fail to provide a service nearly five months later, not to mention that customers held hostage by Citibank lose out on the opportunity to save money by refinancing with a credible lender. I genuinely think Citibank simply decided to pause all of their "" in process '' applications to the detriment of their loyal customers.

07/30/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"I walked into a CitiBank branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX on XX/XX/2020. I sat down with a branch rep named XXXX XXXX. There were advertisements posted all over the wall of the branch marketing the "" Citi Priority '' banking product which would offer a promotional deposit of {$700.00} into the account after conditions were met : 1 ) Within 30 days of account opening, deposit {$50000.00} into the qualifying account 2 ) Maintain the {$50000.00} balance for 60 consecutive days 3 ) Payout of the promotion is 90 days after minimum requirements are met In effect, I had to maintain {$50000.00} in a low-interest savings account for 150 days ( 5 months ), in order to receive the payout of {$700.00}. 

That payout was due last week. I called the bank to see why I hadn't received my payout, even though I had made close to no interest on {$50000.00} that was in their money market account. 

They told me they will launch an investigation. A day later, I noticed something strange. Whenever I would login to my Citi account, it would recommend I upgrade to "" Citi Priority '' to get extra banking benefits. That was really strange since I had always been on Citi Priority up to that point. 

After a couple of days, I received an quite shocking update to the investigation : I was told that I never signed up for the "" Citi Priority '' account package, instead having signed up for an inferior "" Citibank '' account package. This account would have been eligible for a reduced {$400.00} payout, with a {$10000.00} minimum balance, but that promotion was never applied to my account at opening. 

These guys literally switched my account type on their end, retroactively modified all my e-bill statements, and claimed I never signed up for the Priority account package in the first place. They XXXX me out of the conditions to get the {$700.00} bonus. 

Thus, I wasted 5 months worth of interest on {$50000.00}, and received neither the {$400.00}, nor the {$700.00} promotional payout.

I sent a 2nd email XX/XX/XXXX which they finally said the acted on by sharing the email with XXXX XXXX XXXX  and that they would get back to me within 30 days and still NOTHING. Absolutely no response. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I haven't received any responses from IQ data or the apartment. I demand the gov't step in and help me resolve this issue as this debt is not valid. 


EMAIL 1 Summary of my issue : I moved into XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX. I had so many issues with the property starting on day one that caused me a lot of very expensive health issues. If we can't get this resolved you will force me to hire an Atty and I will not only sue for the property being inhabitable and you guys destroying my credit but, I will sue to have the management company cover all of my medical bills incurred during my time living in the apartment. So I feel strongly this is in your best interest to resolve this immediately. 

The apartment smelled of pet urine, cigarette smoke, and possibly had mold. I notified the apartment management in person right away. I also made them aware that I am XXXX XXXX, and have XXXX  and that the smells triggered both of these health issues for me. Additionally, I had a water leak issue from my washer machine that took months to get the management company to fix. The apartment did absolutely nothing to remedy the environmental issues after several attempts. Then, I started having XXXX. This was new and my doctors were sure it was due to my unhealthy living situation and told me I needed to remove myself from the environment right away. This has been fully documented in my medical records. 


I was forced to move out on XX/XX/XXXX and I kept in contact with the management company through the whole process. It was my understanding I was given the approval to move out so you can imagine my surprise and frustration when I saw this bill show up as a collection on my credit reports. 

I look forward to hearing back that this collection was removed from my credit and it was resolved. 

Best regards, XXXX XXXX Dtaed XX/XX/XXXX Tenant 's Right to Break a Rental Lease in Nevada  Many tenants who sign a lease for their apartment or rental unit plan to stay for the full amount of time required in the lease, such as one year. But despite your best intentions, you may want ( or need ) to leave before your lease is upfor example, if youre a student at XXXX and only want to stay in your apartment for the period of time that school is in session. Or perhaps youre moving in with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes, you may need to move in order to be closer to your new job or an elderly parent who needs your help. 


Leaving before a fixed-term lease expires without paying the remainder of the rent due under the lease is called breaking the lease. Heres a brief review of tenant rights in Nevada  to break a lease without further liability for the rent. 
Tenant Rights and Responsibilities When Signing a Lease in Nevada  A lease obligates both you and your landlord for a set period of time, usually a year. Under a typical lease, a landlord cant raise the rent or change other terms, until the lease runs out ( unless the lease itself provides for a change, such as a rent increase mid-lease ). A landlord cant force you to move out before the lease ends, unless you fail to pay the rent or violate another significant term, such as repeatedly throwing large and noisy parties. In these cases, landlords in Nevada  must follow specific procedures to end the tenancy. For example, your landlord must give you five days notice to pay the rent or leave ( Nevada Rev. Stat. Ann. 40.251 ) before filing an eviction lawsuit. If you have caused substantial damage to the property, your landlord may give you an unconditional quit notice, giving you three days to move out. ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40.2514 ). 
Tenants are legally bound to pay rent for the full lease term, typically one year, whether or not you continue to live in the rental unitwith some exceptions, as follows. 
When Breaking a Lease Is Justified in Nevada  There are some important exceptions to the blanket rule that a tenant who breaks a lease owes the rent for the entire lease term. You may be able to legally move out before the lease term ends in the following situations. 
You Are Starting Active Military Duty If you enter active military service after signing a lease, you have a right to break the lease under federal law. ( War and National Defense Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 App. U.S.C.A. 501 and following. ) You must be part of the uniformed services, which includes the armed forces, commissioned corps of the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ),  commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the activated National Guard. You must give your landlord written notice of your intent to terminate your tenancy for military reasons. Once the notice is mailed or delivered, your tenancy will terminate 30 days after the date that rent is next due, even if that date is several months before your lease expires. 
You Are 60 Years of Age or Older and Need to Move Because of Physical or Mental  Disability Under state law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.340 ) older ( 60 years of age plus ) tenants who must move  because a physical or mental disability may break a lease if they need care or treatment that can not be provided in the rental unit, provided that specified conditions are met ( such as giving proper written notice to the landlord ). 

If your landlord does not provide habitable housing under local and state housing codes, a court would probably conclude that you have been constructively evicted ; this means that the landlord, by supplying unlivable housing, has for all practical purposes evicted you, so you have no further responsibility for the rent. Nevada law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.360, 118A.380 and 118A.490 ) sets specific requirements for the procedures you must follow before moving out because of a major repair problem. The problem must be truly serious, such as the lack of heat or other essential service.The Rental Unit Is Unsafe or Violates Nevada  Health or Safety Codes Your Landlord Harasses You or Violates Your Privacy Rights Under state law in Nevada, your landlord must give you 24 hours notice to enter rental property ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.330 ). If your landlord repeatedly violates your  rights to privacy, or does things like removing windows or doors, turning off your utilities, or changing the locks, you would be considered constructively evicted, as described above ; this would usually justify you breaking the lease without further rent obligation. 
You Are a Victim of Domestic Violence State law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.345, 118A.347, 118A.510 ) provides early termination rights for tenants who are victims of domestic violence, provided that specified conditions are met ( such as the tenant securing a valid protection order ). 
Landlords Duty to Find a New Tenant in Nevada If you dont have a legal justification to break your lease, the good news is that you may still be off the hook for paying all the rent due for the remaining lease term. This is because under Nevada law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118.175 ), your landlord must make reasonable efforts to re-rent your unitno matter what your reason for leavingrather than charge you for the total remaining rent due under the lease. So you may not have to pay much, if any additional rent, if you break your lease. You need pay only the amount of rent the landlord loses because you moved out early. This is because Nevada requires landlords to take reasonable steps to keep their losses to a minimumor to mitigate damages in legal terms. 
So, if you break your lease and move out without legal justification, your landlord usually cant just sit back and wait until the end of the lease, and then sue you for the total amount of lost rent. Your landlord must try to rerent the property reasonably quickly and subtract the rent received from new tenants from the amount you owe. The landlord does not need to relax standards for acceptable tenantsfor example, to accept someone with a poor credit history. Also, the landlord is not required to rent the unit for less than fair market value, or to immediately turn his or her attention to renting your unit disregarding other business. Also, the landlord can add legitimate expenses to your billfor example, the costs of advertising the property.

If your landlord rerents the property quickly ( more likely in college towns and similar markets ), all youll be responsible for is the ( hopefully brief ) amount of time the unit was vacant. 
The bad news is that if the landlord tries to rerent your unit, and cant find an acceptable tenant, you will be liable for paying rent for the remainder of your lease term. This could be a substantial amount of money if you leave several months before your lease ends. Your landlord will probably first use your security deposit to cover the amount you owe. But if your deposit is not sufficient, your landlord may sue you, probably in small claims court where the limit is {$10000.00}  in Nevada.

I called and was told that I could not pay Macys directly, I had to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. And that once I paid the balance they would update Macys in 24-48 hours with payment. And to allow Macys an additional 7-14 days to make sure payment posts and Macys would zero out the balance and update my account to all credit bureaus. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. A rep told me that they could offer me a settlement of {$340.00} if paid during the call. I asked her to confirm that it would show my account was settled with a {$0.00} balance. She said yes and confirmed what the Macys rep said, to pay and allow 48 hours for update and they would notify Macys payment was made and account was settled. I asked if she could send me something in writing to confirm. The rep took my fax number and on XX/XX/2020, she sent me a letter confirming everything. After 14 days, XX/XX/2020, I contacted Macys and asked about updating my account. Macys states that they received the payment for {$340.00} and I still have a balance of {$420.00}. I explained the settlement and she said that my account will eventually update but could not tell me when. I have called and held hours, and no one has been able to assist me with getting the account updated. I even tried to call XXXX XXXX to pay the {$420.00} that Macys says is due and they will not accept it because the account has been paid as agreed. I really need to get this account updated. I am in the process of trying to get my life back on track and purchase my 1st home. My mortgage loan is pending the resolution of this account.

I indicated that the charge was not mine. Instead of stopping the charge, they allowed it and I was billed at the end of the XXXX billing cycle. I contacted Citibank in early XXXX and was advised that they would reverse the charge and send out a new card for the one used in the fraud. No new card was sent at that time and the charge was not erased on the XXXX billing cycle. Called back in XXXX and was told that the charge was not a fraud charge but was an internal transfer of a previous fraud charge on my account in XXXX, XXXX. I had changed from the Shell Drive  for 5 card to the Shell Rewards card and they indicated that a previous fraud charge was being billed to the new account. I had previously been credited in XXXX for the XXXX fraud charge so I assumed that they would also reapply the credit since it had already been resolved. As of XXXX the fraud charge has not been removed. I have had several conversations with Citibank and opened 3 or 4 fraud reports. Since the fraudulent charge occurred on the old account numbers the Citibank fraud team has not opened their fraud investigations on the proper account at least 3 of those times. They have always opened the fraud investigation under the new account numbers. The fraud investigators don't find anything and and close the investigation with no feedback to the person who created the initial claim. Since XXXX I have been told two different stores - 1 ) not a real fraud charge just an internal transfer and 2 ) really a fraud charge and finally had a new card issued in XXXX two months after Shell/Citibank actually contacted me about the fraud attempt. I pay my bill in full every month but because I was advised that I was not responsible for this XXXX charge I have deducted this from the payment. I closed the account out of frustration because of being misdirected by Citibank on so many different occasions and because they seemingly can not execute on getting this issue resolved. In a recent phone call I was advised that the previous accounts attached to the `` Drive for 5 '' card are in fact still open. I have no idea why those accounts are still open as I used Shell 's website link when I was logged into my online account to "" upgrade '' to the Shell "" Fuel Rewards '' card. I don't understand why the original account was left open when the new accounts were created. Additionally, the fraudulent charge occurred on the old account numbers but is showing up on the statement with the new account number/card. As a result of this as of XX/XX/XXXX a credit has finally been issued for the {$85.00} on the old account number but my new account number still has a {$170.00} balance because of the interest charges they have applied against my account as well as the late fees for the past two months. And today I was alerted by my credit monitoring that they are now reporting me as past due to credit agencies. I pay my bill in full every month but have deducted this charge and the interest amounts as well as fees based on them telling me that I am not responsible for either the charge, the interest charges or fees. The company looks like utter confusion because their Security and Fraud division have given different reports of the issue at hand. Last contact with them was on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX where I had to request that the credit applied to the old account be moved to the new account. I was told it would take 7-10 business days for that to happen. As of this morning, it hasn't. I suspect that next I'll have to call them back to remind them to remove the interest charges and fees.

08/07/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"American Pacific Mortgage, ( APM ), is making a Demand for {$13000.00} in Insurance Premium. 

APM is stating on XX/XX/XXXX that the Property Owner 's Casualty Insurance underwritten by XXXX XXXX underwriter XXXX XXXX in California is "" Canceled. '' APM asserts that it called the Insurer XXXX by telephone and has documentation from said insurer that the casualty insurance policy is canceled. APM refuses to share this documentation. 

XXXX XXXX has provided documentation on XX/XX/XXXX that all Casualty Insurance was paid in XX/XX/XXXX and is in full force through XX/XX/XXXX or paid in full for the entire contract year. 

We have all documentation showing that Casualty Insurance is paid for the entire Annual Premium into XX/XX/XXXX, that no lapse in insurance coverage has ever occurred, that APM assertions are erroneous due to either their inattention, inadvertence, neglect or willful negligence and fraudulent conduct. 

APM actions violate Federal and State laws, may constitute consumer fraud against the insured and attempt to EXTORT premium inappropriately from a Senior Citizen and USA Veteran of XXXX XXXX. This is easily elder abuse and consumer fraud. 

This conduct on the part of APM, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX, is exactly the same conduct that the separate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  of XXXX XXXX XXXX in Minnesota and its XXXX XXXX, Iowa customer service department engaged in around Year XXXX. 

These Federal Mortgage Lenders are engaging in EXTORTION of Egregious Insurance Premiums from consumers who have already paid for their own Casualty Insurance. 

We understand that the current Federal Administration has fined XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$8.00} XXXX dollars in around XXXX for similar actions. 

We were attacked on 2 properties in XXXX with excessive Insurance Premium Demands, which is extortion. 

In one case at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, the payments were prepaid by over {$15000.00}, while XXXX XXXX demanded another additional {$13000.00}. Noone in the Obama Administration, nor California government, did anything to stop the criminal fraud and wrongdoing that occurred from XXXX forward. We still seek redress for the theft of our XXXX, CA homestead where over {$400000.00} of 30 years of hard-earned equity was outright stolen from us, with foreign nationals now living in our custom built homestead. 

This fraudulent pattern can not repeat. What APM is doing to XXXX XXXX, USA Citizen and USA Veteran, is exactly what happened in XXXX : A Demand for Over-payment of Insurance Premium with an egregious Demand amount. 

Thank you for any assistance. 

Very Sincerely, XXXX XXXX, Owner, Trustor and Insured.

Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed  and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices can provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS. 

It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

The other main reason for the refinance was to pay off high interest rate credit card debt. 
This debt amounted to {$45000.00}. This was to be paid by the mortgage company directly to each credit card company. Statements from each card company with mailing addresses and account numbers were provided to Bank of the West to assist in paying these cards. 

By XX/XX/XXXX I began to check if these cards had been paid and they were not. I called Bank of the West Loan officer several times and they said the payments were mailed. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and still none of these credit cards has received payment. 

After a week and a half I find it hard to believe the payments were ever mailed. I asked Bank of the West for evidence that the payments were mailed and can not provide it.

08/03/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"I recently refinanced my residential mortgage with LoanDepot. The loan number is XXXX. The closing took place on XX/XX/2020 ( in person and socially distanced ). I was provided a hard copy of the closing documents. In the closing documents signed on XX/XX/XXXX, the loan amount was {$580000.00}. A closing balance from me, as the borrower, of {$1600.00} was required. Hence, I wired the {$1600.00} as instructed. So far so good. However, replacement closing documents were unexpectedly provided to me on XX/XX/XXXX. In those documents, the loan amount was increased to {$580000.00}. I was surprised by this, but, nevertheless, the terms were acceptable to me because a balance would be owed to me ( and, of course, my out of pocket costs would be refunded ). I signed the documents electronically. According to these replacement closing documents, I would no longer owe {$1600.00} out of pocket at closing. Instead, they showed that {$560.00} would actually be owed to me. Of course, since I already had paid the {$1600.00}, that amount would need to be refunded to me. In addition, {$560.00} would be paid to me. This totals {$2200.00}. I took screen shots of the documents that were provided to me on XXXX and signed electronically by me on that day. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote to LoanDepot to obtain their plans to pay me. I have since then made repeated requests and they have only said that they would look into this. I am now disturbed by their continual lack of attention to this matter or even to confirm that they owe me money. If this were difficult to figure out, I could understand their lack of a substantive response. However, not only is it straight forward, but all of the relevant information is in their possession.

I was then informed that the {$120.00} was not enough to settle the account. I then proceeded to ask why they hadn't even applied that towards the collections.

We added a student checking account for our son when he was XXXX years old, and he is now XXXX years old. 

Approximately XX/XX/XXXX, he was robbed at gunpoint and they stole his debit card as well as his online bank login. He did not report this to the police at the time because he feared for his life. Starting on XX/XX/XXXX, BB & T has photographic evidence of other individuals depositing fraudulent checks into our son 's checking account at a BB & T ATM. The signatures on the checks did not match our son 's signature. On XX/XX/XXXX a check for {$3500.00} was deposited, on XX/XX/XXXX a check for {$3500.00} was deposited, and on XX/XX/XXXX a check for {$3500.00} was deposited. None of these deposits were caught by BB & T, and all of the funds were allowed to clear the following day. Subsequently, the money was transferred out of the account by XXXXXXXX or XXXX. We were never made aware of any fraudulent activity or overdrafts until XX/XX/XXXX by email, when we saw our son 's account was approximately - {$10000.00}. 

BB & T initiated a fraud investigation, and said that they needed the police report and for our son to come into a branch to look at the photos of the people who deposited the fraudulent checks. We filed the police report, and that investigation is ongoing. Our son went to look at the ATM photos, but he did not recognize any of the people making the fraudulent deposits. We were then treated quite rudely by several BB & T employees as we tried to understand why these fraudulent checks were ever cleared by the bank. We were lectured about how we should be better parents and our son should be more responsible. We were told that the investigation was closed until the police report was submitted. No one could answer our questions about why these checks were accepted. Deposits into our son 's account rarely ever exceeded {$300.00}, but somehow three {$3500.00} check deposits were not even flagged or looked at more closely. The signatures didn't match, the addresses did not match. With such relaxed check policies, we were shocked that BB & T was attempting to hold us liable for the fraud. 

XXXX, in the payments department, told us that we had until XX/XX/XXXX to set up a payment plan or until XX/XX/XXXX to pay in full. We sat on hold for an hour on XX/XX/XXXX to set up a payment plan but were never able to speak to an employee. The following day, BB & T force transferred every available dollar from our savings accounts ( {$5500.00} ) to pay for the negative balance. XXXX, in payments, then denied ever telling us we had until XX/XX/XXXX or that we could set up a payment plan. 

Now that BB & T has taken our money without our consent, we are doubtful that they will ever re-open their investigation once the police report is available.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TN,371XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3777974

07/29/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I contacted USAA to do an interest rate reduction refinance loan for my VA home loan that is currently with USAA. I went through application, and when I received my disclosures, saw that the required disclosure "" IRRRL Comparison Statement and Recoupment Calculation '' was wrong. I contacted USAA and my mortgage specialist acknowledged there was an error, but said she didn't know if she could fix it. I told her I wanted to know the actual numbers before deciding on the loan. 

On Saturday the XX/XX/XXXX, I got a call that asked me to send an email/photos of what was wrong. I sent it the same day, with two issues : I was looking for a loan comparison that normally comes with a cash out refinance, which apparently doesn't come with an IRRRL -- - and I was looking for a corrected IRRRL disclosure. I sent photos of the document with notes to clarify the error. 

On XXXX XXXX, I got an email from USAA 's Loan Originator telling me that "" we are talking about different things '' and "" Unfortunately, we would not be able to generate that document for an interest rate reduction refinance. '' On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from the mortgage assistant stating the same, and affirming that despite the number being grossly wrong, "" management '' told the assistant they weren't going to fix it or send out any more disclosures. 

A huge factor in refinance is the recoupment for the loan cost. My current loan is with USAA, however, they incorrectly list PITI and PI as the same amount, despite knowing otherwise. They own my current loan and have ready access to this information. The comparison rate lists the new PI, and comparison PITI correctly, and this "" funny math '' makes the time to recoup closing costs grossly incorrect. 

I was told the actual savings for buying down points would be somewhere around {$400.00} per month, with points at the cost of over $ XXXX. However, the disclosure incorrectly states the reduction in PI to be almost {$1100.00}. This is almost 200 % the amount I was verbally told. At this reduction, it would only take 10 months to recoup closing costs, which is what the disclosure states. I have asked repeatedly for an accurate disclosure and was told "" no ''. 

I think it's wrong to lie/mislead a customer, much less a Veteran. I have banked with USAA for over 18 years, and I was really shocked that the primary disclosure for IRRRL was grossly wrong. USAA wasn't willing to fix it. I have not received an accurate disclosure.

The balance is supposedly {$3400.00}, with an amount past due!! 
There is also a collection that has been added to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX involving this Citibank account. 

I have never opened a credit card account with this company, and I have never inquired about getting debt with this company. I do not believe in the use of debt to obtain financial freedom.

Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX  or XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices can provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS. 

It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I called Radius back XX/XX/2020 and was passed around until I got XXXX, the supervisor, again. I explained that I am trying to get a mortgage loan and needed this removed immediately. I told him that the previous rep with Radius verified that the account had been recalled. XXXX verified that it was recalled but he could not get it removed from my credit report. I asked him if it made since that they would continue to report a collection that was XXXX out because it was a billing error. XXXX stated that he did not want to misinform me and have me saying that he told me something that was wrong. He stated that they dont normally receive calls requesting this, which I find hard to believe. But he said he would research and that I could call him back Monday and he might have some info. He said he would reach out to the department that does recalls. I do not believe XXXX was being honest at all.

08/04/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I called SPS Servicing mid XXXX about the payments for XXXX and XXXX we're having trouble with on my rental property my son lives in. We've both been impacted by Covid with reduced income, but his employment and income was almost stopped because of the Covid virus impact. 

I told them I wanted to do a forbearance for the payments for the next 6 months as he's getting income coming in now, but will take time to catch up. I asked them to send me the paperwork to complete for the process, and they said they would. NO one told me the paperwork was on their website, I waited for it to come in the mail. 

When I got many letters from them, none contained the paperwork to complete, but one was the NOTICE OF DEFAULT! This is the start of the foreclosure process, which the CARES ACT  was to keep lenders from starting until XX/XX/XXXX per the federal law. I was upset to say the least that I received NO paperwork on requesting help, but a NOD! 

Since I thought, the request maybe handled online, I went online XX/XX/XXXX, and completed the request for forbearance online. I called XX/XX/XXXX and talked to several people ( although wouldn't transfer me to my relationship manager single point of contact ), and they told me they have no application showing my request. Even though I got a confirmation email the request was received ( attached ). Apparently there is a link that says, 'having trouble due to Covid ',  and I needed to fill out that request and not the one that said - need payment assistance. I was not able to complete it as it said I have an application in the system. 

In all the letters they sent me, I received a letter that I have a relationship manager, but they would not forward me to him. The person told me she reset the system so in 15 minutes I would be able to complete the COVID forbearance information. I tried several times, and I can not get the application I already completed with income and reasons for issue. 

My fear is this house has a lot of equity, {$150000.00} ; and the mortgage company is not going to cooperate with this forbearance request. If they start to add on the foreclosure costs, I will not be able to catch up the payments and their MASSIVE foreclosure fees. I can not get the relationship manager to talk to me, and I'll be bounced around until the loan is not cured and foreclosure will move to sheriff sale and all the fees involved. 

We are now 3 payments due and will be making one payment this month, and should be caught up by end of XXXX, worst case XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",AZ,850XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3778592

The price of the truck was XXXX. I gave XXXX cash and trade in a vehicle XXXX more for a total of {$5000.00} down payment. It was financed for XXXX making 48 payments of {$520.00} My finance charge of APR was {$9900.00} So far I have paid 45 payments for a total of {$23000.00} and 3 remaining payments due in XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$1500.00} which will be the full amount paid thats in the contract which is XXXX that reads in the contract. For my surprise I called the bank to request a payoff and they told me it was {$3600.00}. I asked them why that amount if I only owed {$1500.00}. They said because wether you pay on time or not they have an extra charge of interest per day for the duration of the loan extra ( I already had paid {$9900.00}. Why another interest extra charge ). With that said, then, what I have in my contract is not true. I will end up paying approximately {$27000.00} instead of {$25000.00} and that is not what my contract reads. In the past 3 days I have been calling them, have spoken to more than 8 agents and until today no one can explain to me where is that extra charge coming from or where does it explain this in my contract. They told me if after I make my last payment in XXXX and meeting the amount completely financed in the contract, I dont pay that extra interest charge they will repo my truck. 
I went into XXXX looking for reviews of Westlake Financial Services and the majority of the consumers just like me were complaining of the same problem. Tons of very bad terrible reviews. 
Therefore, this is why I am requesting to please consider my complaint and help me find out if what they are charging me is legal or not.

I believe that your actions are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Section 1692 ( g ) subsections 809 ( a ) ( 4 ) and ( a ) ( 5 ) ; and subsection 809 ( b ), and are not done in good faith. Secondly, derogatory statements that were placed on my credit reports by your company have not ( to this date ) been removed. Your actions appear to be done with unclean hands.

Based on my prior letter to you ( XX/XX/2020 ) I informed you that I do not recall owing the said debt to XXXX. Please note : This is my Second Attempt to obtain validation of this debt that you are telling me that I owe to XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Receivables Performance Management, LLC",AL,None,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,07/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3765515

I was under the impression that though interest would accrue on regular purchases, promotional periods should have been extended during this unqiue and tough time for customers. 

On XX/XX/2020, I sent a message requesting Covid-19 assistance and to inquire about the extension of the promotional period for a promo balance that expired XXXX and had a balance left of {$93.00}.

With most creditors there is often a 30-day grace period given after a promotional balance expires to allow the customer to get it paid off within one month and avoid the bulk interest, which I inquired about as well.

08/07/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"We purchased a home in XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage company was Lakeview Loan Servicing , LLC ( subservicing by XXXX ). We later refinanced with the same company to get a lower interest rate. We signed all the closed on XX/XX/XXXX, and began paying on our newly refinanced mortgage shortly thereafter. After several issues with billing ( incorrect amounts, unexplained late fees, misapplied escrow funds ), we decided to refinance with a completely different company just to get away from Lakeview/XXXX. We started that process in early XX/XX/XXXX. During the application, my new lender informed me there was no Record Release filed when the other loan closed on XX/XX/XXXX. It was suspected Lakeview/XXXX did not file the paperwork properly. This meant we could not continue with the refinancing until that document was filed. I called Lakeview/XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, to request a copy. I was given an internal email address and told to expect a response within 24 hours. I immediately emailed them and received an automated response with a ticket number. waited 48 hours with no response. I emailed them for a follow up. I received another automated response with a different ticket number. I called Lakeview/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, to get an update. They had no record of my emails. They said they had the file, would make an investigation request, then get back to me within 3 business days. After 5 business days with no response, I called again and requested a supervisor. The supervisor said there was no indication that Lakeview/XXXX   "" sent the paperwork and the check to the county. '' So, technically, the loan was never properly closed by Lakeview/XXXX  back in XX/XX/XXXX. They said they would investigate and close it by XX/XX/XXXX. It was supposed to be filed no later than 60 days after signatures. That created a big problem for us because the rate lock for our refinance expires on XX/XX/XXXX. If the new mortgage company does not receive all the paperwork by XX/XX/XXXX, we will have to pay to get the rate lock extended, because Lakeview/XXXX failed to comply with the law and file the necessary paperwork and fees within 60 days of signature. We believe they should be held accountable for non-compliance with the 60 day filing rule and they should also be responsible for any extension fees we have to pay to extend our rate lock. We highly believe that, had we not decided to refinance with another company, Lakeview/XXXX still would not have processed the required documents and it would have been a complete mess when we decide to sell this property in the future.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",CO,809XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3785230

When my husband returned to work, I reached out to her via email and she advised that I needed to submit a new application. When i reached out regarding the appraisal we paid for and if we could use it, she did not respond to my email. I tried to call her and she did not answer and I left her voice messages. 

I finally called the customer service line for XXXX and the gentleman I spoke with could not assist and told me that our appraisal is to about to expire in XXXX and we can not move forward with the appraisal since the rate lock since XXXX never filed an extension as she promised and if we put in a new application, we would have to pay for another appraisal. 

The gentleman, I think his name was XXXX or XXXX, mentioned he would reach out to XXXX but I never got a call back or any follow up from either of them.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"ONY GLO, INC.",WA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3782866

Then I went to get gas, and the card was declined. I called and they told me that there was a restriction on the account until the power of attorney documents arrived - this makes no sense, as the primary card holder, my father, has made no changes to the account at all, and until the XXXX arrives he is still the person they should talk to. In other words, they conflated the question of whom they could talk to about the account with the question of who the authorized users of the account are. 

Meanwhile, I was stranded with less than XXXX miles worth of gas, and was given no warning of the restriction.

The 3 Day rule was violated in bad faith as the changes remained unknown until the next day when we were informed we were still ~ {$4100.00} short. We had to secure this money, with no notice as to why, before our keys would be released to us. We had consummated the closing the day prior. No party involved knew there was a change in Closing Disclosure ; on Monday XX/XX/2020 it was stated that we were funded and good to go. There was no notice we were still short and that the wired amount was insufficient. We did not waive the waiting period under any circumstances, implied, ambiguous, certain or otherwise. The dollar amount wired to conclude the transaction was based on the only Closing Disclosure in our possession. 
As the change ( s ) to the Closing Disclosure made by Eagle Home Mortgage was both a surprise and not in our favor, EHM should be considered to be non-compliant and to have acted in Bad Faith. 

Party 1 : Buyers XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Party 2 : Eagle Home Mortgage Underwriter : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Subject address of transaction : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX Evidence : We have evidence that the new Closing Disclosure was made on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX pacific, XXXX central. This is a fact that can be proven as the document is timestamped for that date. On the time of closing XX/XX/2020 at XXXX central, the only Closing Disclosure available to us in our portal was apparently an older one ; the new one was not produced, provided, uploaded. The Title Company was unaware this was a new document. We have evidence that as of the next day, XX/XX/2020 the new Closing Disclosure was still not uploaded or made available to us. On the next day, the Title Company articulated that they too were confused at the lack of funding and they were unable to reconcile how they had a Closing Disclosure which was different from the Closing Disclosure that was found in our Portal on EHM 's site. There were no emails which informed us that there was or would be a new Closing Disclosure. 

Attempt to resolve : Upon calling XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020 he stated that he had been compliant and cited the relevant statute. Obviously, this was an inaccurate statement. 

We can and will provide the evidence required to support the allegation of non-compliance and Bad Faith. 

As of the day of this Complaint, XX/XX/2020, there is still no new Closing Disclosure provided to us ; there is still no explanation of detrimental change of costs.

In XX/XX/2020, I called customer service to ask about enrolling in biweekly payments. They told me I had to wait until I had made the first mortgage payment and made NO mention of any fees associated with me simply splitting my monthly mortgage payment into biweekly payments. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer service again. They said I would have to fill out a form [ which they emailed to me ] and said I could NOT simply submit biweekly payments without filling this form. They said those payments would NOT be applied as intended and would be considered "" short payments '' and held until final monthly payment was received. They made NO mention of a fee associated. 
Once I received the email with said form, it stated clearly and multiple times that I was required to pay a {$150.00} FEE. 
I called customer service back and asked to speak with a supervisor. She repeated the above information and said that it was "" non-negotiable '' to dispute this fee. 
I told her this is a SCAM and they should be reported for such price gouging! I have paid home mortgage payments for most of my adult life! I have never encountered a bank that charges any fees, much less a fee of {$150.00} to simply "" allow '' me to make my payments in a biweekly fashion. This fee should be illegal and this bank should be held accountable for scamming it's customers. This would always be an egregious charge -- but now during this economic turmoil and the largest unemployment rate, it is even more CRIMINAL that this bank is trying to scam {$150.00} out of it's customers.

XXXX XXXX Merchant ) sent a letter to Synchrony letter attached saying that they delivered architectural plans, please I requested from Synchrony to provide me those formal documents since XXXX has not send any documents to me. Architectural plans needs to be certified by a licensed architect and approved by me with my signature. 

I never requested architectural plans as you can read in the contract provided by XXXX, architectural plans was never quoted. 

In order to work on the property, the City of XXXX needs to approves the architectural plans. Please Synchrony gets these documents from XXXX. 

If XXXX has bought material why the material was never deliver to me? Does XXXX provide proof of any material delivered to me and for what amount? and what kind of material? 

XXXX offered free estimate in their website XXXX why a walk through is now taking in consideration for the {$25000.00} payment? 

I never cancel a contract please provide a proof that XXXX has send you that I had stop the project? and for that reason 30 % cancellation fee was enforced? 

Too many inconsistency that Synchrony is not providing to me that they conduct an investigation and that the merchant is providing enough proof to justify taken {$25000.00}. and from Synchrony to take a decision against my favor. Only a contract signed is not a proof of service delivered. 

If Synchrony is validating the contract as a proofs of services delivered to me, therefore Synchrony bank is saying that fulling understood the terms and conditions of the contract and that it is assuring I received and I approved architectural plans, that I received material for an unspecified amount, and that I formally stop the project and for that reason I need to be enforced 30 % cancellation fee.

I was told that the funds would be trasferred to Wells Fargo no later than XX/XX/XXXX yet the money still has not left my bank account.

I am aware he is behind on payments - what can I do to get the loan into my name? "" .I never received a response from them of any kind. 

It wasn't until XXXX, when I was made aware that the house might go into foreclosure that I was advised that my ex-husband needed to execute a third party authorization in order to speak with me since my name was not on the loan. On XX/XX/2019, I sent the requested signed document to Flagstar. 

The loan was modified in XX/XX/2019 ; however, it has come to my attention that Flagstar should have contacted me when I notified them in XX/XX/2019 as to what my courses of action were to get the house transferred to me. Had this been done, I would have taken care of that ; the house wouldn't have fallen into foreclosure and I would not be looking at a home loan that is more than {$10000.00} greater than the original loan due to my ex-husband 's violation of the court order for support payments, subsequently resulting in lack of payment.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"FLAGSTAR BANK, FSB",OH,44001,None,Consent provided,Web,08/05/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3780247

07/28/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"My daughter and son-in-law have applied for a rate reduction ( also called streamlined refinancing ) on a loan they hold with Freedom Mortgage. My wife and I are co-signers on the loan. The loan is FHA insured. As part of the process, Freedom Mortgage provided us a link to review and sign documents. One of the documents is an Occupancy Agreement. This document requires that we certify that "" Borrower intends to occupy the property ... as Borrower 's primary residence. '' All four of us are listed as borrowers. As co-signers, my wife and I are not intending to occupy the property, but my daughter and son-in-law currently do occupy the property and intend to continue to so. For my wife and I to sign this document would be a false statement and would also leave my daughter and son-in-law vulnerable to the lender calling the loan or adjusting the interest rate. 


I brought this problem to the attention of the Loan Advisor on Thursday XXXX XX/XX/2020. Her response back to my son-in-law was "" while your in laws are not required to occupy the property, we are not able to edit the document because the is how it is generated. That being said, in order to move forward we would need the documents signed as they are ... '' In other words, if you want us to continue processing this rate reduction, lie and sign the document. My son-in-law has communicate with the Loan Advisor on at least three more  occasions trying to resolve the issue with no success. An excerpt of one of the emails states again "" Unfortunately, that is the way the documents are generated and would need to be signed as they are in order to move forward. '' Another email stated "" I understand the concerns. However if you look at the documents they also state they are preliminary. They are auto generated, and I can not make any changes. This is how all the packages go out when there is a non-occupant co-borrower. Unfortunately I dont have another solution. '' To my knowledge, this has all been done by email ( other than my original notification to the XXXXoan Advisor which was verbal ). The Loan Advisor has made no attempt to engage myself or my son-in-law by phone to resolve. 


Today ( XXXX XXXX ), I've made three phone calls to Freedom Mortgage to engage someone more senior in the company. The first attempt, I was on hold for 30 minutes after being referred to a supervisor with no indication of someone helping. The second call dropped five minutes after being referred to a supervisor. On the third call, I was on hold for 20 minutes before the call dropped. The agent called me back and I was on hold for over an hour waiting for a supervisor before the call dropped again. The agent sent an email for someone to call me back. 


I consider the conduct of this company to be extremely unethical basically suborning perjury. The company has refused to modify the documents to be truthful. 


The documents must all be signed within the next 30 hours for the process to continue ( even though the rate lock doesn't expire until XXXX XXXX )",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,WA,981XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3768239

No interest is paid on that money, but interest continues to accrue on the mortgage. Then 2 weeks later, payment 2 is made, and then - and only then- both payments are applied to the mortgage. 
This is an insane arrangement that no one in their right mind would think is OK. the money from the first payment is out of my control, presumably put in another account, and not applied to the mortgage? I receive no benefit, but do receive the downsides of not paying the mortgage, continuing to accumulate interest on the mortgage, not getting interest on the money in my account, and running the risk of overdraft fees.

08/03/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,None,"In XX/XX/2020, we discovered that our county had placed us in an incorrect tax bracket, causing our real estate taxes to dramatically increase. I contacted a supervisor with Loancare, and during our conversation, discovered the cause and the method to correct the tax issue. Since it was going to take time for a new escrow assessment to be completed, and the fact that our county offices were closed down due to COVID-19, I asked the supervisor how we could prevent it from appearing that our mortgage account was over 30 days past due which would initiate reporting to the credit bureaus. The supervisor stated that she would place 3 months of credit suppression on the account to prevent the negative reporting to the credit agencies. 

In late XX/XX/2020, while on a call with another rep. regarding the escrow issue, I discovered that credit suppression was never applied to our account as we were told, and that negative credit reporting had indeed occurred. I was transferred to another supervisor who actually pulled the recording of the XX/XX/2020 phone call and confirmed that I was told by the first supervisor that "" 3 months of credit suppression '' would be placed on my account, which should give ample time to repair the escrow issue. 

Fast forward to the present, XX/XX/2020, and I am still attempting to get the company to correct the negative credit reporting that should of never happened to begin with. I have spoken with more that 5 supervisors, spent hours on the phone ( nearing 8+ hours as an estimate ), been given promises of call backs, and one supervisor named XXXX XXXX even told me to call him after a certain number of days and he would help with follow-up. He is now not answering my calls. The final supervisor I spoke with in late XX/XX/2020 said she was again submitting a request to have my credit corrected, and that I would get a call back in 5-7 business days. Once again this has not occurred. I feel I have given Loancare every possible opportunity to make this situation right, and am baffled by the lack of attention, follow-up, and failure to assist a customer with a simple matter that is impacting me financially. Bottom line is I was promised 3 months credit suppression on a recorded call, and the failure to implement this has caused months of stress and aggravation as I have spent hours attempting to get this resolve in a civil manner. 

Although Loancare 's reps have been polite and reassuring on the phone, the simple fact is I have been deceived multiple times, and feel that my issue simply isn't worth their time. Having a background in customer service and as a personal banker for several years, I am appalled at the level of dismal service I have received, and only hope no other customer has to suffer their attempts to correct problems. I simply seek resolution to their mistake so that I will be financially whole. 

As a final attempt at resolution directly with the company, I just competed another call to Loancare that was 1hr 13min in duration. I spoke with a very polite supervisor named XXXX ( rep # XXXX ) who stated she was again submitting an escalated request to repair, and included the initial recording of the XX/XX/2020 call including timestamps referencing the initial supervisor promising credit suppression ( footprint # XXXX accessible by supervisors only ). She stated that I should see resolution in some form on my account by XX/XX/XXXX, and would have to call in to find out what it is if I do not receive an email. I am continuing with this filing for the simple reason of being given the same information several times now hoping that resolution would actually come.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",SC,295XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3777577

All i needed to do is write my name address and phone number. I wrote the info down along with my XXXX XXXX address. She said your all set. You will be getting your card in 10 to 15 days. I then went to swipe my card and she said not to pay until i receive my bill. I thought about it as it was only XXXX dollars or so. But i was glad i got the 15 percent discount. So i walked out the door. This was in late XXXX. I saw no bill in ten to fifteen days. Forgot about it. Finally got a bill in late XXXX or early XXXX. It. Had no Home Depot card and came with a XXXX dollar late fee. After several phone calls, prompts and getting nowhere I talked to a real person, whom I told that this was the first bill I had gotten. They were rude and acted like I was lying. I was so fed up I hung up the phone. Didn't no what to do or who to call. I thought I was being scammed. Making several more calls I realized I was dealing with Citi bank. At this time after many phone calls, being on hold for hours, I talked to a woman who gave me the home depot number. Talked to a supervisor who looked up my account info and said that they sent it to an address in New York that I hadn't lived at in ten years. Not once but the bill was sent there twice. I had a home depot card, but threw it out ten year ago. He understood the problem and I said would pay the bill for my purchase. No. Late fees.

07/24/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Step 1 : What is this complaint about? 

After 40 years of living in my home and XXXX years old, I was forced to vacate my home by XX/XX/XXXX, due to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC/PHH Mortgage Corporation refusing to take payment during a prolonged one-year Loan modification, hardship requests and number of denials to save my home. I received empty promises from several relationship managers that informed my house would be saved by stating that, Not to worry because were not trying to take your home, which lead my home into placed into foreclosure proceedings. They refused to remove my mother from the deed of trust, as well as her income from my household income while she was living in a XXXXXXXX XXXXthey refused to remove my mother after she had deceased on XX/XX/XXXX. I went through several modification packages and notary publics to prove to them that my mothers income was not included in my household. Therefore, there was a change in the household income, which caused hardship for a single senior citizen woman on a fixed monthly income. 

Step 2 : What type of problem are you having? 

I spoke to several relationship managers but not my assigned RS Manager because he/she was never at my disposal. There were a few relationship managers who had substantial language barriers that were difficult to understand what they were trying to inform me. One relationship manager told me from Ocwen Loan Serving, LLC/ PHH Mortgage XXXX that my modification was denied twice after they had recommended me to fill out the paperwork several times, including submitting my financial records several times, my mothers financial information, and going to a notary public. I had visited the XXXX XXXX  business office to obtain my mothers financial information during the time of the modification. My mother had XXXX ; I was required to submit my and my mothers financial information numerous times, I was later informed that the information was all lost. Before sending the financial information, I wrote a letter informing Ocwen/PHH Mortgage that my mother no longer resides with me. Ocwen/PHH Mortgage refused to accept my mortgage payments unless I include the delinquent amount in full after being reassured by several relationship managers that I would not lose my home and not to worry during our monthly relationship management calls and not send payments right now while applying for modification or hardship requests. Also, I received several notification posts hanging from my doorknob for me to call them in between the other monthly calls. After several months of stress and anguish dealing with this mortgage company, I received a letter and a phone call that my home was going into foreclosure, and I could contact the mortgage lawyer in charge of the process. When I contacted PHH Mortgage lawyer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), they informed me that they had not received any modification or foreclosure paperwork and reassured me that I had nothing to worry about. 

Step 3 : What happened? 

My home was forced into foreclosure. I had no choice but to move out by XX/XX/XXXX, to live with my daughter, because my house was being auctioned after owning home for 40 years. I had to move a houseful ( 5 rooms ) of furniture into storage or be thrown out before the auction.

Step 4 : What company is this complaint about? 

Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC/PHH Mortgage Corporation Step 5 : Who are the people involved?

07/24/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,In XX/XX/XXXX my mother passed. I then took power of her estate. My children were already living in the home with my mother. I never assumed the mortgage. After about 3 months I called Wells Fargo to question the PMI on the home and if my mother had over coverage I was informed ( several times ) over the next 4 months no & it would not be dropped till I assumed the mortgage. I did get a lawyer and get the title in my name. In XXXX of XXXX my company which served as two incomes for me closed & their were none in Maryland. I was employed with in a few weeks of them closing I contacted Wells Fargo in XXXX and Informed them of what was going on and that I would receive unemployment shortly they said to make a payment as soon as I can. I called them in XXXX to pay 2 1/2 payments of the 3 that I owed and was told that they was unable to take the payments and it would need to be paid in full ( I have proof of contact for dates ect ). Thats all I had for the time being. I was told later they could have put the payment on the back end of the mortgage or I could have paid XXXX to XXXX more for a few months to catch up. At that point XXXX set in and it was building after about 3 weeks of 100 different answers from Wells Fargo someone threw a call one day suggested that I try for a modification. All I asked was if the PMI was dropped on the home it would bring the mortgage payment down by XXXX to XXXX a month less then XXXX and I could breath. My mother died young and worked very hard to keep this home. Im now finding out that Wells Fargo has possibly committed a breach of contract with my mothers mortgage as well as with the handling of the PMI Insurance on the home. I have filed paperwork with a Maryland senator as well as file complaints against Wells Fargo with their own office due to the first part of my trying for a modification I was discriminated against and told that I would never be able to afford this mortgage it was investigated by members of their staff room I do still have messages as well as contact information and dates and times and was found that I was discriminated against by an employee and stay in return gave me a chance for another modification. I have Been through two different lawyers discrimination with them lied to as far as the terms of my mothers mortgage and the whole time Ive Only wanted to keep the home. I am finding out now that there was several other actions that could have been taken and they should have directed me to HUD or FHA Due to the mortgage and that is who would have handled the PMI. That was never done they automatically sent me into a modification due to their tactics of sending people to modifications knowing they will disapprove them for their own reasons to ultimately send the homeowners into foreclosure with the homes. I am in the process of communicating with several lawyers to investigate the terms of my mothers mortgage as well as the PMI on the home which is why I believe Wells Fargo continue to deny me for the modification because they would intern receive a {$200000.00} payout as well as still be able to sell the home. This is unfair it is unpractical it is everything that goes against anything that they are supposed to stand for This is unfair it is unpractical it is everything that goes against anything that they are supposed to stand for. I do not in tend to quick even if I cant stay in our home I will continue to push this issue and I will continue to go after them for what theyve done to myself as well as my children and my mother. There Has to be justice for this to continue especially with this company for these modifications and what they do I am now because of two lawyers out of over {$3000.00} there is seven people in the home that will have to relocate as well as we may have to relocate out of state I also filed against the attorney who did not follow the correct paperwork to stop them from being able to file the lift the stay in my chapter XXXX I will also have to claim in chapter XXXX meaning I can not do that prior to moving this has utterly and completely calls me beyond stress from the beginning it was something that Wells Fargo couldve very well put one and a half payments behind me or possibly had me paying I am now because of two lawyers out of over {$3000.00} there is seven people in the home that will have to relocate as well as we may have to relocate out of state I also filed against the attorney who did not file the correct paperwork to stop them from being able to file the list of stay in my chapter XXXX I will also have to claim a chapter XXXX meaning I can not do that prior to moving this has utterly and completely calls me beyond stress from the beginning it was something that Wells Fargo couldve very well put one and a half payments behind me or possibly had me Pay extra XXXX to XXXX a month in order to catch up on the payments or directed me to Hud to deal with the PMI on the home that was no longer required there was so many other ways that we couldve went about this over a payment that was only a month and a half behind because I had the rest of the payment,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MD,210XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/24/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3761971

08/14/20,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"At this moment, I do not recall how I became aware of this debt, but I phoned the collections company on XX/XX/XXXX to request a detailed invoice for the debt. When I last talked with XXXX, no one could tell me what the debt was for. 
In short, the phones I received from XXXX did not work, I returned them. At that time I paid a restock fee and asked to pay any outstanding bill. The rep double checked and said I did not have one.  Later that month I received a bill for {$1700.00}. I called the store, but in the end, no one could tell me what the bill was for and subsequently stopped answering my calls. The next month the bill was {$1500.00}. I eventually got through to an online customer service rep and they realized some of the phones were not returned. After updating my account, there was still a balance for {$240.00}. He could not tell me why. 
When this balance showed up in collections, I phoned the company on XX/XX/2020. I informed them that XXXX could not tell me what the bill was for and before I would pay, I wanted an itemized invoice. Given all the inaccurate info they previously reported, I wanted to be sure this is a valid debt. The rep seemed to agree. On XX/XX/2020 I received an alert on my credit report for this balance. I had not heard back from the collections company. I phoned them to inquire about what happened since our last conversation. XXXX XXXX informed me that she was aware of my previous request and that I previously told them that I did not believe it was a valid debt. She said they did not receive a reply from XXXX and stated that she made another request while I was on the phone. I asked is it appropriate to report a debt you can not verify, she said yes. She stated the call was recorded so this can be confirmed. My primary concern is because I have no accounts in collection on my report and have a business transaction this could kill. She said give her a week and I do not have a week. 
I am asking they honor their first conversation with me. Prove the debt is valid and give me an opportunity to pay. I truly do not understand how and why I am expected to pay a sum of money just because a company said so and how a collection company can report a negative account without proof of the debt. 
Finally, this was a XXXX XXXX acct, I feel it was not set up properly if it is reported on my personal account. I was told my personal info was only needed for the credit check. this is more of a XXXX issue.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICES, INC",NJ,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/14/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3795231

07/31/20,Debt collection,Auto debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"This incident involves three companies : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX   '' ), United Services Automobile Association ( "" USAA '' ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX  '' ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was in an accident where a USAA insured driver, Ms. XXXX XXXX, was at fault. USAA claim number is XXXX. USAA paid for my car to be fixed and I was given a car by XXXX to use while my vehicle was in the shop. After returning the rental car when my vehicle was fixed, USAA was billed for the amount of {$470.00} for the 16 days the rental car was in use. USAA decided to only pay {$290.00} for what they estimated should be the price for a rental car. XXXX only billed USAA and I never received nor heard anything again after dropping the rental car off from USAA nor XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that a derogatory account showed up on my credit report. The derogatory account was for a collection agency, XXXX. After investigating with XXXX on what this was for, I found out that this was for the XXXX  leasing for the accident that USAA was supposed to cover. XXXX sent me the paper work they had on file. That was the first time I saw the bill to USAA for {$470.00}. A person at XXXX noted on the bill that they only received {$290.00} from USAA. There was renter information on the bill for myself but all of my contact information was wrong, but it was billed to USAA 's address for for USAA to pay. USAA should have taken care of this since it was their insured driver at fault. 

I contacted USAA to inform them that their bill was showing up on my credit report and asked why they didn't pay this bill and how to resolve the issue. They argued that they didn't owe the full amount because it exceeded the estimated 10 days to fix my vehicle. I told them that it was out of my control on how long it took to fix my vehicle and the rental car bill included weekends as well. They realized that they had made a mistake and thought the bill was for 16 business days instead of the actual 11. They agreed to pay XXXX an additional {$140.00}. 

I contacted XXXX to make sure that they received the additional payment. They did receive the {$140.00} from USAA, but an outstanding amount of {$120.00} remained on the bill because of derogatory fees. I contacted USAA again to explain that there was still a balance on the bill. They refused to pay it because they don't pay derogatory fees. I thought this was ridiculous because these are derogatory fees for their bill they ignored. This is a bill to USAA that was never billed to me and is now showing on my credit report. 

I contacted XXXX and asked if they would drop the derogatory fees since my renter information was wrong on the bill, I was never contacted by USAA nor XXXX, and I was not at fault for not receiving a bill that wasn't actually billed to me. They agreed to wave those fees but an amount of {$44.00} remained. By this time, I could not deal anymore with this matter considering the amount of time I had spent trying to fix this. I payed the remaining {$44.00} even though this was billed to USAA and they should be the one 's to pay this amount. I never thought I would be in an accident where I was not at fault and have to fight so much with the other driver 's insurance agency. If USAA is doing this to me, they are doing this to many people. 

If I was billed for a rental car, I would have paid it. USAA was billed for this rental car. They should have paid their bill!",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,DC,200XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3773365

More charges continued to come in. 
I immediately reported the theft to my campus security officer and called US Bank and XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX all personal accounts I had at both banks showed multiple credit and debit accounts with fraudulent activity ) that day and spoke with one of US Bank 's representatives to make the above claim as well as regarding debit card activity. At that time US Bank rep made me aware of the fraudulent charges named in a report made with the XXXX Police  Bureau and FTC ID theft report, made on the morning of XX/XX/2020. The amounts included in the police report were based on the amounts given to me by US Bank representative as they had not yet posted to my account online. I actually worked to transition the bulk of my direct deposits and bill pays from XXXX  XXXX XXXX to US Bank because of how helpful and dedicated US Bank representatives were initially. 
I then complied with everything US Bank investigators asked me to do, including faxing the police and ID theft reports to the US Bank Fraud Department on XX/XX/2020.

When I did not receive a called from XXXX, I called the fraud department again on Monday the XXXX and was told that a police report was never received. I refaxed both reports on Tuesday XX/XX/2020 and called to confirm that the fax was received. I spoke with XXXX who confirmed that the fax was received. At that time, I expressed additional concern about the handling of this case. XXXX stated that she would have XXXX manager, XXXX, call me back. 
I received a call from XXXX, not XXXX, on the morning of XX/XX/2020. XXXX stated that he would not change the ruling as both the bank card and ID were used at a teller to make the cash advances. I explained to him that my ID was stolen along with my card and he stated that information did not matter as the transaction was made with a teller. I explained to XXXX that during the time of the theft my county, where this took place, was still under a Stay at Home order from the governor of Oregon as a result of COVID-19 ( see XXXX XXXX   XXXX ). At the time of the theft, nearly all bank transactions were made with drive-through tellers ( most branches were closed ) and masks were required for any business transactions indoors. With drive-through tellers and masks, a mistaken identity would have been understandable. According to XXXX, he would also not take this into consideration, stating that the signature on the advance requests seemed to match mine on the fraud claim. Again, this thief had possession of my drivers license that had my signature on it, making it incredibly easy to forge! 
My cards AND my drivers license ( which featured my signature ) were not in my possession. In fact, as documented in the addendum to the police report, the entire wallet was mailed back to me by a local business who found the wallet and contents soaking wet on their grounds weeks later ( I have kept the wallet, envelope it was mailed in and letter from the establishment. ) Furthermore, there were numerous other fraudulent charges, withdrawals made on XX/XX/2020 with my US Bank accounts and XXXX  XXXX XXXX accounts, which XXXX also stated he would not consider because of the signature in question.

08/07/20,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"CREDIT ACCEPTANCE IS THE WORST! 
Tennessee law requires that your lender send you a 10-day letter after it has repossessed your car. This letter is official notice that youre entitled to redeem the vehicle by paying off the loan, plus fees and costs associated with the repossession. You then have 10 days to come up with the money, and your lender cant sell the car until after this redemption period has passed. 

Predatory lending is any lending practice that imposes unfair or abusive loan terms on a borrower. It is also any practice that convinces a borrower to accept unfair terms through deceptive, coercive, exploitative or unscrupulous actions for a loan that a borrower doesn't need, doesn't want or can't afford. 

Prepayment penalties plus they made my note seem cheap just to add unnecessary charges and taxes when I tried to pay. 
When I extra and paid on time I was still marked as late. AND LITERALLY NOTHING WENT TO MY ACTUAL BALANCE. 
My car stopped working two days after I got it, I notified them. They wouldnt do anything about it or defer at least one payment. When I finally got it back working. The ALTERNATOR AND STARTER WENT OUT ON A 2014! 
I told them that this goes against LEMON LAWS ( literally the same week I got my car ) I WAS PAYING A NOTE ON A CAR I COULDNT USE FOR TWO MONTHS!! The MOTOR WAS BAD. They gave me the car and supposedly it had a oil change. WHY WAS BLACK TAR COMING OUT. The pieces connect to the oil container were melted on and the piece had to be broken off at XXXX. Over {$600.00} for the replacements. they wouldnt give me the info to do a LEMON LAW claim so I mailed it to them! Which is what the state says to do to claim lemon laws and they are supposed to forward it. 
They failed to notify me of selling the car ( AFTER I TRIED TO GET IT BACK the next day!! because I put a lot of money into it AND THEY WOULDNT GIVE IT BACK ) which is required BY LAW. I literally had the cash amount to pay it off from a school refund. They told me if I paid it off early I would have to pay a lot extra ( prepayment fees ) Their loans are so predatory! My interest kept changing. 
They sold my car while I was trying to get it back and literally didnt notify me that the sold it. Not even a letter in the mail! 
Not to mention, when I called to get deferred because the XXXX WAS NOT WORKING. The lady asked me why did you get a car if you dont have money to fix it then I said maam could we keep it professional and she cursed me out. I hung up and called back. Only had one nice man that I would talk to! This company is THE WORSE COMPANY I EVER EXPERIENCED. 
Now they wont settle with me or delete it off my credit when its not my fault and I tried to reconcile! YOU SOLD ME A XXXX AND WOULD NOT LET ME DO A CLAIM OR GIVE IT BACK. I lost my job messing with that car A GOOD JOB. 
I got the car on XX/XX/XXXX, it stopped on XX/XX/XXXX. Got it fixed and it stopped completely in XXXX In total I have put more than $ 2k in the car",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,TN,381XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3783897

08/10/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Ive been diligently paying off my balance on my Best Buy card. When covid quarantine hit in XXXX i started paying all my credit cards on the day i received my direct deposit into my bank account to make sure they got paid each month. I also started paying more than the balance due to pay off my balance and alleviate XXXX payment due each month. My friend in XXXX died on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX from the virus and i have XXXX and XXXX so i am at an increased risk to get a severe case or die if i get infected. 
What I didnt realize was that best buy c/o citibank was applying my monthly payments to the previous months cycle starting in XXXX when they attributed my XX/XX/XXXX payment as a second payment to the XXXX billing cycle and then assessing me a late fee for XXXX. Apparently citibank closes each months billing cycle on the XXXX of the following month. The Best Buy app doesnt alert you to which billing cycle your payment will be credited to when making your payments online, nor does it say youre making a XXXX monthly payment. Neither does best buy/citibank send you an email or alert you that a late fee has been assessed to your account. Each month the late fee is increased. 
I caught the late fees and called to speak with best buy citibank. They said they could only remove XXXX late fee and it was my fault for not understanding that the payment due date and the billing cycle closing date are XXXX different dates. 
I spoke with multiple people on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to get a callback from a senior account XXXX to discuss the situation. I was told i would get a callback the following day. I did not receive XXXX. I called back and again spoke with multiple representatives and recorded the conversations and disclosed that i was recording the call. I told the gentlemen that XXXX payments were credited to XXXX when i intended XXXX to pay applied to XXXX and that i was since then being assessed late fees each month for paying too early on each month. He kept putting me on hold to review my account. He insisted that he only saw XXXX payment per month and the late fees were justified. It was only when i looked up the dates of payments applied to the XXXX billing cycle that he was able to see the XXXX payments. When i asked to speak with a senior account manager he kept placing me on hold, returning to ask me to wait longer, and then he just hung up on me. I still havent been contacted by any senior account rep. 
In XXXX, best buy citibank sent out a lengthy email statement saying they were working hard to assist their customers during the pandemic and i have enclosed screenshots. 
So how are they helping me by applying payments to the previous billing cycle, assessing me late fees totally almost {$150.00} and refusing to understand my intentions at paying early, refusing to adjust my payments, and remove the late fees, and either not having a senior account rep return my call or disconnecting me?!!! 
This is a deplorable and opportunistic way to assess more debt to a customers account during an pandemic where they give lip service to trying to help their customers and offering postponement of monthly payments if requested due to financial hardship.

08/01/20,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"Good morning, I applied for a HELOC loan with US Bank. When I applied for the loan, US bank asked me to send my credit cards debt by the time. I sent the information to them. My balance on XXXX   credit card was {$9000.00}. When they approved the loan they send me the check playable to chase. Since the loan approval took more than a month, I paid to chase credit card in that time the amount of {$1300.00}. When I went to the bank with the check I got from US Bank they didn't accept the check because the balance was lower ( {$7700.00} ) than the check amount ( {$9000.00} ). I called US Bank and they send me another check for the right amount of {$7700.00}. I paid off the balance to this credit card. 

The issue is I'm paying to US Bank the amount of {$9000.00} + interest ; but the real money I got from the bank was {$7700.00}. Meaning I'm paying {$1300.00} dollars I never received. For any reason US Bank put the original check amount on my loan. 

I started to call the Bank, I don't remember how many times and how many hours explaining the Reps about the issue but they never solved it. So I started to send emails with unsuccessfully results. I got all emails related to this issue, the copy of the check provided by XXXX, etc. 

Since there is no US Bank branch in XXXX, it is impossible to solve any issue by phone or email. 

I really appreciate your help.

07/30/20,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"RE : Fingerprint Requirement to cash checks - Possible Security RISKS to personal technology and privacy - MUFG Union Bank  Office of the President and XXXX XXXX XXXX CFPB, MUFG Union Bank, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX : This complaint was filed due to not receiving any response about my check cashing experience at your bank located in California. I am a current safety box ( Signature Card Holder ) at branch that cashed check. Please ask XXXX that she can verify my signature on file and she knows me as I am a former employee. Is this the way you treat ALL former employees of the bank? 

On XX/XX/2019, I went to the local branch of Union Bank or MUFG Union Bank and wanted to cash a check written to me from my mom ( Check Number XXXX in the amount of {$760.00} was drawn on Union Bank ). I went to the teller window and was asked for 2 pieces of Identification. I had that and provided it. Next, they asked me for ID to cash my mom 's check. I was shocked at the request and had the employee ask XXXX ( Customer Service Manager ) if I still had to give the fingerprint even if she can vouch for me as a her former employee. According to her, I was required to provide the fingerprint. It hurt me that they did not trust me cashing my own mother 's check. 

Trust is very important and I did nothing wrong for them to treat me less than equal to other former employees. Also, due to the new smartphone technologies, fingerprints are now more a security or privacy risk and can be a possible violation of 4th amendment rights. The use of fingerprints as unlock feature can pose as this risk and the bank should protect consumers, as well as, find new ways to secure assets. No one believes me. 

I previous complaint was filed with the CFPB and hope this can be resolved correctly. Can you please ask XXXX XXXX why I am unable to bank with my family at Union Bank or MUFG Union Bank and to avoid these type of check cashing issues in the future?

Wells Fargo Executive Office Wells Fargo, N.A. Member FDIC I have made several phne calls to Wells Fargo and tried to resolve the issue. They do not call me back and do not even email me. I was hung up on a call today XX/XX/2020. I have a XXXX retirement account with Wells Fargo and attempted to set up an online account to access it. The person who originally set up account was ok. My quarterly by mail paperwork that comes from Wells Fargo Retirement Services suggested to open an online account to access up to date information on this account. I did so. It also talked about 2 step authentication for added security. When I attempted to set up 2 step authentication my account got locked.It has been 3 weeks and employees at Wells Fargo I have spoken to do not know how to fix problem. They tell me I must visit a branch to resolve issue. I worked for XXXX and they have hundreds of employees all over XXXX XXXX in states with no Wells Fargo Banks. Are all of us not going to be able to access our accounts online? All I asked them to do is unlock account and help get 2 step authentication set up and they don't seem or are unwilling to do so. This is the worst bank I have ever dealt with in 40years of banking. They have very unprofessional and ignorant people who can not properly give excellent customer service.

Due to hardship induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, I fell behind on my mortgage payments. I attempted to call numerous times ( at least 12 ) to fix this issue during the months of XXXX and XXXX ( before I went delinquent on the account, but I was never able to get through to a representative, sometimes leaving my phone on speaker phone for over an hour while I waited ), and I called at least 5 times during XXXX and XXXX ( after being late on my payment ). In XXXX, I was able to make contact with Shellpoint ( about 2 and a half weeks ago ), and the representative there explained that I had a caseworker for my account and to call that person the first week of XXXX to discuss an option that was available to me. It was explained that this option would make FHA assume 3 of my mortgage payments and add them to the end of my loan, fee and interest free. A part of my loan program allows me to move at least one payment to the end of my loan as a part of my terms and conditions anyway, and when I spoke to the representative 2 and a half weeks ago, I explained that to her as well before she gave me the first option mentioned above. I also explained this to the representative today who continued to read me a letter I've never seen before that didn't mention any of what I was told, and the place she advised me to go just kept referring me to options that didn't fit my situation. My initial intent was to move one payment to the end of my loan term ( benefit spelled out in my terms and conditions of my contaract ) and make 2 months worth of payments to be completely caught up and current, but because of what I was told, I used the extra money to pay other creditors I owed. This situation needs to be remedied. I feel asking me to make my full forbearance payment right now i unfair and deceptive.

Since XXXX, my family and I had XXXX as our home security. In early XXXX, a technician came to our home claiming to be an XXXX tech and stated they were going to their customers home to schedule appointments, as a courtesy, to upgrade their security equipment to their latest model. He stated the system we had was outdated and they are having trouble with many of their customers with the same systems. We agreed to the update/ upgrade. Before the tech left our home, he stated we had to sign, stating we agree to the upgrade and that our bill would be discounted because I was XXXX XXXX military. 

Approx 2 months later, I called XXXX because I was having constant beeping issues with the system. The XXXX rep advised me that I did not have an active account with them and that the service was disconnected. I explain to the XXXX rep of the upgrade by their technician and what happened. The XXXX rep stated no one from their company came to our home and did any installs and nothing was wrong with our old system. She stated that it seems we were scammed. 

I then tried to contact the tech that came to our home and no answer, so I called the number on the card he left us. I explain to that Customer Service rep of what happened and she stated they are XXXX and not XXXX. I told her that I would like to cancel the service as we did not agree to change company. The tech stated he was from XXXX. 

The customer service rep stated we signed a contract and would have to pay the termination fee if we cancelled. I then asked to speak to manager because this was fraud as we were misled that we were upgrading our existing XXXX monitoring system/ equipment. I also stated that I will pursue legal action against this company, with our XXXX XXXX Legal office because I am sure this was illegal. 

The rep placed me on hold. After several minutes of holding, the rep stated they will agree to cancel the contract and that we would be at a month to month service agreement with them. She asked that we give them another chance to fix the system and keep the service. I agreed to the month to month service and the rep transferred me to troubleshoot the beeping noise. 

Throughout the next year, we continue to have issue with the alarm, as it would always say ( red button ) that our doors and windows were opened. Also, we had problems with the alarm "" arming ''. 

In late XXXX, I called XXXX and advised the rep to TOTALLY disconnect the service and that I was switching back to XXXX. After the call we never heard from XXXX since, until we received this collection letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a letter dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX in which I mailed a letter back to them disputing this debt on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX.

On XXXX XXXX, I sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX  disputing this debt again, also within the 30-days dispute notice. 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX reported this debt to my XXXX  report, but listed it as PERFECTION Collections, LLC. I have never received a letter/notice from Perfection Collections, LLC. Per my XXXX  Credit Report, the address for Perfection Collections, LLC is the same as XXXX XXXX XXXX.

The AAG said it would take five to 10 days to respond to the request. Since the the closing was scheduled for XX/XX/2020 this was not acceptable. Numerous call were made to the AAG Payoff department by the title company and the mortgage holder but they refused to provide a mortgage payoff. Because of the refusal by AAG three houses could not be closed as scheduled. 

The mortgage holder requested to talk to a supervisor they were told it would to 24 hours before a supervisor would be available. I believe they were just stonewalling me. I would think that the payoff could be determined quickly. If I called a bank or credit union I could get the payoff of a loan while I was on the phone. Additionally, they said that the payoff would be as of XX/XX/2020. This means since the request was made on XX/XX/2020 that about 28 days of interest would be received by the mortgage company that they did not earn, in affect the broower was being charged a penalty for payoff the mortgage early.

I did not see them til around the middle of XXXX due to the fact I do not use my credit card that often so didn't open my bill upon its arrival. My daughter who pays my bills immediately called the company and got them to close the account and issue new ones unfortunately they only issued one to her mine never came. That was the XXXX statement when we saw them closing date of XX/XX/2020. We called the company and talked to a XXXX on a conference call in the fraud department and he said there are other charges from a car rental I am assuming you have not been anywhere else would like me to get rid of those also and we said yes. So on the bill closing date of XX/XX/2020 the charges had been removed we had a new account and assumed everything was taken care of. Imagine our surprise when opening the new account bill dated closing date XX/XX/2020 there was a charge from XXXX rent a car in XXXX Fl for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX posted to the account on XX/XX/XXXX. This time my daughter called the company and we did a conference call so they knew she could talk on my behalf and talked to a XXXX who assured me after explaining what was going on they were all removed and she kept saying its marked as fraud why is it there. What was confusing to us and no one can give us an answer on is how those charges were able to be put on our new account. So again we assumed it would be taken care of silly us upon opening the statement dated XX/XX/2020 it was still there so we called again on XX/XX/XXXX because we were able to be together in my daughter 's car spoke to a XXXX  in the fraud department who after hearing of our situation and veifying my information immediately put us on hold for 10 mins and then someone called XXXX got on the line and put me thru the 3rd degree asking me questions that no one had ever done to me before since I am XXXX I got a little confused and my daughter tried to help and the woman said he must answer where my daughter said well he won't know that answer because i don't even know that answer. Once she listened to us she said yes there is fraud i can see that my daughter said do you see the one from XX/XX/XXXX she said yes I will get it taken care of and we will change your account number and send you new cards. Unfortunately the XXXX statement came and the XXXX rent a car charges from Oklahoma have been removed they were XXXX but not the XX/XX/XXXX. So my daughter has now been checking it online and they have not yet removed the one from XXXX nor have they sent us new cards. We wrote a letter and sent it to them and have yet to hear from them and I will now be marking my statement disputed and only pay those charges that I owe. My daughter has locked the account so no one can use it also.

The amount billed was {$2800.00}. In XX/XX/2020 we received the following email from XXXX  stating that they were canceling our reservations and were not going to refund our money : From : "" XXXX Customer Service '' XXXX Date : XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX EDT To : xxxxxxxxxxxx Subject : YOUR XXXX   CANCELLATION Dear Xxxxxxxxxx Please be advised that, due to the DO NOT TRAVEL alert issued by the US State Department due to Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) threat we have cancelled your upcoming international trip. 

The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. 

Please note : XXXX paused operations on XX/XX/XXXX as this crisis was unfolding, so we ask that you please note the following changes to normal procedures : Your resort reservation will be cancelled automatically. All cancellation fees have been waived. You will need to speak to your credit card 's issuing bank for your options as a cardholder. If you wish to reschedule your stay to a later date, please do so directly with your selected resort, although we are of the understanding that many resorts in your selected area have temporarily suspended operations. 

If your vacation includes flights, your flight portion will be cancelled when the airline you have booked officially cancels your flight, or within the next seven days, whichever comes first. Each airline is handling this crisis differently, and refund policies are changing by the day. Again, speak to the airline about your options, and to your credit card 's issuing bank for your options as a cardholder.

We received a letter from Synchrony dated XX/XX/2020, denying our refund request. Synchrony stated that the reason for denial was the sales transaction appears to be authorized by you and/or received by you. While it is true that we authorized this purchase, we never received any services because XXXX cancelled our reservations. On XX/XX/2020 we re-filed our complaint with Synchrony and faxed them a copy of the XX/XX/2020 email from XXXX It has been over 60 days since the second complaint was filed and still we have gotten nothing in writing from Synchrony regarding this second complaint.

08/05/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Costco Citibank credit card. On this date I specifically and expressly opted-out of automatically renewing membership charges by expressing this to the Costco clerk and providing alternative payment. I received assurance that no charges would be posted on the account for membership fees. I obtained this card as an emergency line of credit due to a personal injury, and never used it. Additionally, during this time, I continued to receive promotional material from Costco and Citibank, which was typically unwanted and discarded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, without my knowledge or consent, and in violation of our agreement, Costco charged me {$120.00} for membership. Because of my status as a XXXX XXXX and Citibank and Costco 's practice of sending useless and unsolicited promotional materials, I stopped opening mail from them sometime before this unauthorized transaction. 

Eventually, this unauthorized charge accumulated interest and late fees. At this point, Citibank apparently attempted to contact me via a phone number that is identified by XXXX or XXXX as originating from a spam number. The number left voicemails in the form via an automated system that uses a robotic voice and is commonly associated with scammers. Citi began sending billing statements that in no way indicated any importance or difference from promotional materials. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Citi began calling from a different phone number that was not identified as spam - again using a robotic voice. When I spoke with their representative, I discovered that they were attempting to collect payment on the unauthorized transaction and fees and interest on that transaction. I requested that they send me copies of my billing statement. 

After receiving the copies and verifying that they were real, I called Costco to have the unauthorized charge removed on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative indicated that the unauthorized charge was removed and directed my call to Citibank to dispute the fees and interest. Upon talking with a Citibank representative, she informed me that the charges were "" too old '' to remove over the phone, and that I would have to write a letter to a PO Box controlled by their disputes department in order to have the charges removed. I wrote the letter according to the instructions I was given and waited. 

I received no response to this letter from Citibank. Figuring they had long turnaround times, I continued to wait. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, a real person from Citibank called me for the first time. They informed me that I would be required to pay the full amount of the initial unauthorized charge plus interest and fees, totaling {$340.00}. I began calling their billing disputes department, which automatically disconnects your call after 2-3 minutes of waiting. After several failed attempts, I called customer service and demanded to speak to a billing disputes representative. Puzzlingly, they were in possession of the letter I was instructed to write, but had chosen not to provide a response. 

The representative informed me that the representative I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX was actually incorrect, and that the charges were never eligible to be removed by their disputes process - not just interest and fees, but also the initial unauthorized transaction processed by Costco.  In the time between these calls, Citibank attempted to add several more interest charges and late fees, while I expected that my dispute was following some formal procedure for processing. The manager of  the disputes department that I spoke to indicated that the charges could never be removed on XX/XX/XXXX in the first place, however he simultaneously offered to remove charges that accumulated after XX/XX/XXXX. The manager stated that the actual purpose of my letter was to create a formal record of the fact that Citibank was not required to remove the charges ; however, I was never informed about this. Citibank is sending a 'corrected ' bill that rewinds back to XX/XX/XXXX, and is still likely to exceed {$250.00} for a transaction that was never authorized. 

Overall, Citibank is attempting to collect the full amount of this unauthorized charge veiled behind a non-transparent billing and collection process. The problem was further exacerbated by Citibank 's provision of inaccurate or outright false information about disputing charges. Citibank is using a complex web of bureaucracy to obscure the billing dispute process, leading to significant consumer harm in what amounts to strong-arm tactics. Citibank obscured their collection attempts for a duration long enough that I could not ever dispute the charges despite their unauthorized nature.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MN,551XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/05/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3780911

So, my balances were a tad bit high but within ' the credit limits. 

Citibank terminates my cards prior to today XX/XX/XXXX. 
Their reasons were defined : "" revolving balances are at or near credit limits ''. This is absolutely absurd. I have a credit limit for a reason. I am not over my limit, I am not exceeding. I am AT or NEAR the limit. 

This is completely discriminatory. This company approved my credit limits and are now cancelling me because I am *NEAR* the balances and they decide to cascade the information to me and leverage their poor "" Fair Credit Reporting Act '' legalities and their absurd policies.

I was happy to pay the {$900.00} despite being laid off and in the tough times of COVID but she was so defiant and said no you knew about this, you made a payment in XXXX, we have been mailing you. Despite me explaining my story she was continuously attacking me. It was disgusting. I then spoke to XXXX, their supervisor yesterday, but she was just as rude saying I can offer you {$1200.00} lump sum payment, but this bill is from XXXX and its XXXX now, I know Covid has hit but you should have no excuse to pay this for now because you should have money saved for this? Are these people XXXX  XXXX? Do they know that Governor XXXX has imposed strict guidelines to ensure that people won't be evicted, so that companies can not harrass them for payments and companies are meant to be compassionate during Covid? I was so angry at her. 

Anyway I want you to acknowledge the following unreasonable and harrassing behaviour of the company - I have been happy to settle with the original amount, I have been trying to contact the hospital directly but they aren't responding. From my understanding medical bills are ineffective after 7 years and this is from XXXX but the collections agency has made this effective from XXXX - I want them to acknowledge that I haven't been aware about this bill, I have been moving around, they can see that from my report I have evidence that my mom is abusive and doesnt help me, and you can see they sold the house in XXXX. They can not express how I knew about this bill and am liable to pay. 
- We are protected in law for any forms of harrassment. The fact that I am willing to pay {$900.00} for something is still a trait of good behaviour, at least appreciate that! The communications back and forth about how I knew about the bill, I am apparently a liar, the fact that its a XXXX bill and I've left this till XXXX to try and make me feel guilty is appauling, these people need to know that the Law is in our favour when it comes to delaying bills and from any forms of harrassment. 

I hope you can look into the bahaviour of this company.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"California Business Bureau, Inc.",CA,902XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3783998

They said that they would take care of it and send me a check right away. 
I hear and see nothing for weeks so go through their chat service on XX/XX/XXXX. They said they had to evaluate the escrow balance and then send the surplus. 
I get a mail response on XX/XX/XXXX saying that they will refund me {$7700.00} and that the check was included in the piece of mail. It was not. They included a sample fake check which I can not cash. I send them another message on XX/XX/XXXX but it's an email since their hours of operation are closed ( no phone, no chat ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter in the mail saying "" due to the complex nature of the matter '' that they request more time to fully respond to my inquiry. The letter was dated on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Shell Point Mortgage has repetitively put off giving me my money and has held onto it for 2 months. They had it for a month and didn't mention anything to me or send a refund.They said they sent a check and the account says it's gone, but they didn't send a check and instead send a fake sample check. They are avoiding paying me and paying me interest since there is no check and they are hoping I don't notice and they have to send a new check. They are abusing me and my money.

I called and the Wells Fargo employee stated that they can see the application and the full details, but yet they did not receive the application. There is nothing they can do, she stated. 

I used a different computer and again applied. Again, their third-party ID verification system didn't work correctly until the fourth attempt. Finally they were able to verify my ID and I complete and submitted my application. The same thing happened again. I was instructed to call. I called and the same story about how they see my application and see the data I filled out, but they didn't receive the application. 

She said my only alternative was to go to a XXXX XXXX store. 

I attempted to contact Wells Fargo via XXXX, but they seldom respond coherently.

07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"A few months ago, Citibank changed their web site. I have a Citi checking account and 2 Citi credit cards. Previously when you view your Card details and click on the Make a Payment button, it displayed the Citi checking account and the user could easily make a payment. You could still set up additional payment accounts. Currently it directs you to a payment setup page that allows selecting a bank ( Citi itself isn't listed on the default page ) or manually entering account details. It no longer provides your existing Citi accounts. You could search and find Citibank among the supported banks. However, the web site is malfunctioning. 

On XX/XX/2020 I attempted to make a payment from my Citi checking account to one of my credit cards. After entering my Citi credentials, it not only wasn't pulling up the Citi account but was also logging me off from the Citi web site completely. I tried a few times, with different browsers and had the same result. Finally I entered my routing and account numbers manually and processed a payment. I was not notified of any problem at that time or during the following week. On XX/XX/2020 I checked my account and noticed a Returned Check fee of {$29.00} and after reviewing my transactions I realized the payment did not go through. I had the same issues processing a payment but was able to use the Transfer option ( which is not at all intuitive or prominent ) to successfully pay my card. 

In addition to the {$29.00} late fee, Citi also charged me interest of {$6.00} and then {$8.00} next month, both of which as a result of the failed payment. I called Citi and they refused to refund either the late fee or the interest charges. 

This leaves me with the impression that Citi intentionally made their web site more difficult to use in order to generate additional revenue from fees.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,328XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/29/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3770186

When I got my bill and saw the minimum payment I set up my XXXX XXXX XXXX online banking to pay my monthly payment to home Depot. In fact I paid an amount in excess of the minimum. Once I had this set up I did not visit your billing since I was on autopay. As luck would have it, I needed to check on one of my purchases. Well did I get a surprise and not a good one. 

I opened my statement and to my surprise I saw an interest charge. How could that be : I have set up auto pay, I was paying more than required. This was very disturbing to me so I called to follow up. 

What I learned was really bad!!! 

So even though the statement showed I had no payment due I was directed to the SMALL PRINT outside the billing information box. There I was advised is the reason for the interest charge and I was introduced to Promotional billing and Revolving charge billing. 

That is a highly deceptive process..statement shows nothing due and then the cleverly disguised revolving charges due. 

THAT IS AT BEST LESS THAN TRANSPARENT AND MORE ACCURATELY SMELLS OF OUTRIGHT DECEPTION. 

WHY NOT BE HONEST AND SEND 2 SEPARATE STATEMENTS : A-PROMOTIONAL BILLING B-REVOLVING PURCHASE BILLING I would like to hear your side of the story before I seek help of FINRA or other oversight agency.

Loan Modification and the last one I  don't remember. there customer service told me that even though my loan is backed up with an FHA loan I needed to ask them for help not them. They have an online request for Covid 19 assistance and she flat out told me that I didn't qualify. Do you know what forbearance is she said you clearly don't know. I had to call each month to make a payment bc they don't allow any transactions. After my third call they changed it and had to explain my account is in forbearance. Yes they are bill collectors and act like one. I was asking them for assistance only bc my husband is furlough and we need help. We made payments up to XXXX. I had to ask for loans bc Mt Bank didn't want to help us out. We don't qualify for anything it seems. they don't work with me only telling me to wait for a loan modification if I qualify. Others around me my neighbors have FHA loans and they moved 3 to 6 missed payments to their mortgage balance. MT Bank doesn't do that. I just had a call yesterday and there was no message left. 
My husband is out of a job so its frustrating using all our savings bc were too afraid of MT Bank. They don't want to help us at all. You don't qualify for nothing. While other banks with FHA loans are sensitive and don't play with you or make you feel like an XXXX. My loan is an FHA loan and I don't feel protected and feel that MT Bank could help more.

I am in very bad financial shape stemming from a very bad employment situation I suffered, and am still suffering at the hands of my ex- employer XXXX that left me in financial ruin, and now I have XXXX XXXX XXXX trying to further ruin me with there aggressive collection tactics and complete disregard for the physical, emotional, and psychological toll I am enduring. The nature of my complaint involved a very aggressive debt collector named "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' whom bought two accounts, for the purpose of this compliant it will be specifically about my SYNCHRONY account. However a second complaint will be filed with regards to my other account with them. In 2017 I started working with a local automotive parts manufacture here in town called XXXX while I was enrolled in college full time. This job really left me in financial ruin, as slowly my wages were not being paid to me. Sadly, the fact that I was left without wages and the owner would string me along and promise to pay me "" next week, next month '' etc, I continued to work without pay expecting to eventually receive my wages. Because I was not getting paid, my credit cards and other bills went into default. One of those is this debt XXXX XXXX bought from XXXX. I have been engaged in a 2 year legal battle with XXXX and it's owners. I have a case with the California Department of Labor and have had multiple hearings and a trial where I was awarded by the court my past due wages. I have attached the court declarations and the complaint against XXXX, so you can read first hand the nightmare I've been through. I even lost my dear Dog because I was unable to pay his continued veterinary treatment. However this judgement awarding me my past due wages has been impossible to collect, and even though I have a court order for XXXX to pay me, I have not received any monies and the situation looks extremely unlikely I will see a XXXX out of this due to the company being now investigated by the Local District Attorney 's office, and they have an F rating on the XXXX  so they have zero chance of actually getting new clients. I am attaching the proof of the D.A investigation and a copy of the XXXX profile so you can see. I have implored XXXX to really help me with this, but instead they just transfer me to there "" legal department '' like i'm supposed to be some kind of criminal. I hope once they see the proof of my terrible situation they will be more willing to work with me. I do not appreciate them making legal threats against me, when I'm simply just trying to resolve my account. they are impossible to negotiate with and I just hope these facts helps them help me pay this off at a reduced amount, and stop threatening me with legal action when I am not refusing to pay.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,CA,933XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3788574

When transacting with their senior loan officer XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX, she intentionally gloss over important information. For example, she gave false information about the impact on my credit file. She claims that since I am shopping for mortgage within 30 days multiple credit inquiries will not impact my credit scoring at all. When in fact it does just to a lesser degree. I repeatedly asked her if they have jumbo loan rates with no points that is lower than a specific number I am already working with. She was very vague and evasive without committing. Most other lenders have no problem with disclosing. In the end, she gave me a rate that I need to pay over $ 30K of points for. She didnt even discuss it in specific details directly when I asked for it and tried to bury this key information in the initial disclosure paperwork.

I have never missed a payment and my payment history is excellent and I have paid much higher than the monthly amount due. I really do not care if they decrease my credit limit but to do so then put me in the negative is a dissatisfaction and shows Synchrony cares nothing about their consumers.

I did the lease-end inspection prior to returning the vehicle to Hyundai. I paid all of the lease installments with no problems. 
One day I received credit alerts from my XXXX XXXX "" credit-wise ''. I looked it up and found out that Hyundai-finance reported that I was 30 days late on my lease-end bill which I never received and only heard about it through the credit bureau reporting. I know that there is a bill that will come any day but never received one. 
The day I heard about the late filing I searched my email and did not see any Hyundai emails. I went to my account online to see if there is a bill but there are no bills/invoices listed at all. Attached is a screenshot from my account. 
By the way, my account is still showing an old bill from XX/XX/XXXX that was paid on time. See the attached payment record. 

I called Hyundai immediately and paid the invoice in full. I asked if they can adjust the negative reporting but they said I have to mail them a request. I mailed my request to the Hyundai dispute department on XX/XX/XXXX but never heard back from them. 
I went on my XXXX account and disputed the negative reporting but never heard back from Hyundai.

Today, I see that they added a 60 days late payment into my credit report. 
My question to Hyundai is, how come I never received a bill from you or your collection department and now I am late in payments that I've never been late on? 
I believe it is my right as a consumer to be given an invoice with billing date and due date.

07/27/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I'm in the process of refinancing a home. I was overdue on one of my credit cards for the month of XXXX, where the credit card was over 30 days late. I brought the account current prior to the credit card company reporting the information to the credit bureau as late. 

I was told by a customer service representative that if I pay for it before it reports then it would not show on the credit report, and this was the case. Since I'm in the process of purchasing a home I've been a hawk about monitoring my credit report. For the month of XX/XX/XXXXthe credit reporting agency reported that my account with the credit card was current for the month of XXXX. 

However, in the month of XXXX the credit card company changed the information that was reported for the month of XXXX. My issue is that in the month of XXXX I began the refinance process and had a clean credit report. So I paid for an appraisal ( {$500.00} ) and to transfer the title of the property that I'm refinancing approximately ( {$1000.00} ). 

As the refinance process came to a close they bank is no longer willing to refinance the home due to the one late payment being reported by the credit card company ( see attachment ). 

My complaint is the fact the credit card company retrospectively updated the information, and if they never retrospectively updated the information I would not be out {$1500.00}. 

Additionally, I was proactive in reaching out to the credit card company detailing the issue on two occasions to no prevail ( see attached letters sent ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,FL,327XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3765533

I was told I could get a copy at my local DMV. I was told I would get the title by fax. I have emailed the finance company twice to complain about lack of customer service. Each time after a whole week of waiting I was told they could not help me by email and I should call the same customer service that I was complaining about. The new owner can not register the car in her own name because lien has not been released. No one at the finance company knows why it's not been released.

08/05/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"My Credit last year was XXXX until late 2019. At that times, I saw my score drop below XXXX. It was all due to a Old Navy Card Visa that I never even activated. I made one purchase on-line with the card, and paid it off in full. In case I missed any balance, I put it on auto-pay. Apparently there was some kind of {$12.00} charge after I paid off the purchase I made. I did not open bills or emails from Old Navy because I had not shopped there and it was on Auto Pay. I finally realized there was a {$12.00} charge ( not from purchases ) that had become delinquent when my credit score went down. I talked to a representative at length and explained it. My bank info was in the system, so there was no explanation why auto-pay did not pay it. I spoke with representatives several times to explain the situation, and demanded that the error be corrected on my credit report. I was assured that it would be. Now, here we are into XXXX, and this credit card account is still reporting delinquencies for XXXX and XX/XX/2019, and my scores are still below XXXX to no fault of my own.

08/04/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used Synchrony 's online website to apply for a credit limit increase to a card that I have been faithfully paying roughly double the minimum monthly payment on, which was denied. My credit limit at the time on the card was {$1500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a paper billing statement as well as a notification of review of my account ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) where I was told my account had been reviewed and Synchrony was decreasing my credit limit from {$1500.00} down to {$250.00}. I called immediately to find out why and was told my account had been reviewed and my credit score wasn't high enough. The letter containing my notice of a lowered credit line also states that my credit score was XXXX at the time of sending, but on Synchrony 's own website where it tracks your credit score, as well as using XXXX XXXX 's application, it shows my credit score was XXXX. So now by lowering my credit limit, it is also decreasing my credit score and they are using that to say I lack the creditworthiness of my original {$1500.00} limit ( of which I am never late ). Also, they are either reporting credit wrong, or using wrong data to support lowering credit limits, which in turn they are using to create worse credit scores, in perpetuity for an excuse. I am currently preparing to buy my first house, and as my credit score trends upward, lowering someones credit limit in order to generate a lower credit score then deny their creditworthiness is patently unfair, and makes me look like a bad borrower. When I called asking my credit limit to be returned to what it was, they said they could only do that by running a limit increase again XXXX of which I was denied, and they would not tell me why. ) As of the time my credit limit increase was processed, my score is currently XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX ( Synchrony ) reporting.

08/06/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Bank has flagged me for fraud and will not release my funds. Customer service is horrible. Never get a 'money account ' prepaid debit card with BB & T ! I have received several deposits over the last month related to delayed unemployment payments, after providing everything one can imagine possible to verify my identity and eligibility - birth certificate, SSA statements, drivers license, 1099 's, pictures of me holding these documents, and the whole system has been frustratingly backed up. Equally my parents and brother have had to do the same thing and as they are ( rightfully! )  suspicious of banks, used my prepaid money account details for their deposits, seemed harmless enough in today 's digital age of XXXX  and XXXX, etc ... Last week, my account was flagged for 'pfraud ' when I tried to make a cash withdrawal. That was cleared up the next day by my 'personal banker ' who was great ( since I was paying for a long delayed bachelor party for a best friend the evening prior, it was HIGHLY embarrassing to say the least. ) Then over the weekend my online access was seemingly terminated and I worked with a rep ( who was great ) and finally the access was restored Monday. Since I've been having these issues and am moving in the next couple of weeks and need a large amount of cash ( deposit = {$2200.00}, first/ last month rent {$4400.00}, pet deposits - 3 cats, 2 dogs = {$2500.00}, not to mention utility deposits and movers ... ), I have been taking money out daily. I drove two hours ( each way ) to the closest branch in XXXX, TX on Mondaythe XX/XX/XXXX and they were unable to assist me with getting a cashiers check and said the back office was closed. I'd called a banker in XXXX who never returned my call. When I called the 800 # on my card today, the rep told me that I ( the cardholder/ account owner ) am under investigation for fraud because of multiple employment deposits. This is a very serious accusation and I just want the money from my account so that I can get on with my life. I am not a criminal and expect to be treated like a customer that has had an ongoing banking relationship with BB & T. I  appreciate the initiative in protecting me and my account, but this is the opposite of that at this point. If someone could tell me what is going on or what I can provide, that would be something more substantial than - you're being investigated for fraud ... It is unbelievable! I have two XXXX XXXX, have had a highly successful career before the pandemic, two quarter million home loans paid in full, and am so insulted by the accusation and will let everyone I know on every medium possible far and wide to never use BB & T if this is not promptly resolved. There has never been ANY communication from BB & T on any of this over the past week or so and if you're going to do something or investigate me, just do it - I'm not some XXXX fraud ring, just a guy and family trying to get through this horrible nightmare of a pandemic we never asked for ... I want this resolved NOW and will continue to escalate and contact the media. BB & T is going to end up leaving me and my family homeless and hungry and I regret the day I ever opened the account. I expect to be able to access my funds for required expenses ASAP!

08/04/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I have filed a complaint about this issue before, and it is still unresolved. ( See CFPB Complaint XXXX ). I have been attempting to deal with this issue for 7 months. XX/XX/2020 we submitted a request for PMI removal. Eventually, NewRez responded and sent a local Broker to perform a Broker Price Opinion to establish current market value for our property. The Broker did not provide an accurate valuation of our property, as he compared our 5 bedroom +Office, 5,262 square foot home on nearly 2 acres of land with homes which were 3-4 bedrooms, 4,000 square feet on lots in most cases less than an acre in size. He listed our home as having 4 bedrooms, 2.1 bathrooms, 3080 square feet. Clearly, this was inaccurate. Despite NewRez requesting him to update information when presented with this, the Broker did very little. I am currently involved in a formal complaint against him with the Tennessee XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, despite hundreds of pages of documentation supporting our claim that the BPO was inaccurate, NewRez will not refund us the BPO fee, nor have they responded to any request we have made to pay for a full appraisal of the property. I emailed them again XX/XX/XXXX requesting this be performed. I received no response. I emailed them again today demanding someone contact me about this matter, or else I will be taking legal action against them. I have hundreds of pages of documentation about this issue, which detail how the Broker undervalued our home. I disputed the issue as requested by NewRez and provided them 6 additional comparable properties. They sat on it and never did a thing. At this point, I am at the end of my rope, and am out of patience. I feel them to be negligent in their duties as servicer of my loan. I am attaching copies of all documentation relating to this issue. This is the 7th CFPB complaint I have been forced to file against this company.

07/29/20,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"US Bank : Thank you for your last response. Unfortunately I have more things to address. In reference to staying in contact with my branch manager regarding my situation, I think you may have missed my point in my previous message. XXXX XXXX, my branch manager, agreed to keep my personal accounts open because they have been open for a while and were in good standing with the bank. US Bank went over her head and decided to close them at a later date. The bank refused to send me a check with my funds sooner than 14 days due to a closure procedure they have to follow due to the type of fraud found on my account, according to XXXX. Despite her best efforts, she can not seem to help me. Therefore, calling her regarding my concerns only interrupts her day, wastes my time, and offers no solution. It really seems pointless to me, not to mention that nothing discussed is in writing to reference should we need to. 

Although I have not had online access to my personal accounts ( or business account ) for some time now and I am sure you have the exact date on record, I have been calling the bank regarding my transactions regularly. This process is definitely more frustrating than seeing my history with my own eyes online as I have to follow voice prompts and the picture I see is far more limiting than logging into my account online, but not once did the voice prompts inform me of unusual activity and I did not see unusual activity prior to me being blocked from my online access. So, regarding the 'Security ' section in 'Your Deposit Account Agreement ' which specifically highlights that you reserve the right to place a hold on my account if you suspect irregular, fraudulent, unlawful or other unauthorized activity involved with my account, I am wondering which of these occurred on my personal accounts? Furthermore, your agreement says that you reserve the right, but there is no breakdown of how the process works or how long it takes. This has caused major inconveniences and stress in my life. I never and still have not received any mail from US Bank regarding my account closures. It seems like a phone call or email would inform me quicker and cause less catastrophe in my daily operations. I do not understand, with it being XX/XX/XXXX, why you could not keep the hold on my account and then contact me with the option to transfer my available funds to another account with another financial institution to avoid putting me in what could very well be a moneyless state for 14 days minimum. It takes money to live. 

Regarding the monitored calls for my XXXX account, you addressed the wrong one in your last message, but it is good to know you do have them on file to reference. Perhaps I was unclear, but I was referencing two attachments I sent in a previous message named 'US Bank Fraud Check ' and 'US Bank Fraud Check Detail ' . As the screenshot of my phone log indicates, I made a call to US Bank on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX for 26 minutes to discuss the source of the funds from the wire transfer before sending the money out of my account per a contract. You could have had a XXXX  risk account had you instructed me properly on what to do that day. That is why the call was made- To act in accordance to maintain a relationship with the bank so that neither you nor I was loosing money or participating in unlawful behavior. What prompted me to contact the bank for a security check was that the name of the company the money was coming from was not the same company associated with the contract. However, sponsorships were a possibility and likely for the type of event associated with the contract. I could not fully read the funding source name in my account because it was cut off. 

Lastly, since all accounts are being closed and it has all been said and done at this point, I am wondering if you will ever report this to affect my credit or possible future banking relationships since you stated you have not already. Am I able to open new accounts with US Bank, perhaps after the pandemic is over as scams and crime has increased with it. Waiting til after the pandemic would lower risk.

08/07/20,Debt collection,I do not know,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"An unknown debt to an unknown company popped up on my credit report on XX/XX/2020. I called the number at about XXXX PST and a live person answered mumbled a company name that did not sound like the company reported on my credit report and immediately put me on hold before I could respond. I rechecked the number on my credit report and called ( same number ) again. A live person answered again but more clearly stated the company and quickly state they had another person ahead of me and put me on hold before I could respond. The person got on the phone asks for an account number, I search the collection flag on my XXXX  credit report and find none, they then ask for my name, which I provided hesitantly because again, the transaction is unknown to me and something feels off about the company. They put me on hold to look me up and returns asking for my date of birth, again I am super uncomfortable but provide it. 

They note some details of a transaction still unknown to me. I say as such and repeat it more than once stating I need written correspondence. The phone agent asks "" are you trying to evade my questions. '' This makes me even more nervous about this call. They note they have obviously legitimate since they have reported to credit agencies. I note that I just sat through and looked through 6 months of mail and I have NOTHING from this company. I thought I might have missed something because we have had to XXXX  related health emergencies on top of everything else and I have not been good about physical mail. The calling agent becomes agitated accuses me of interrupting them, not allowing them to speak and evading their questions, and puts me on hold. 

Returns and continues the conversation and when I restate I need physical correspondence because I am afraid this may be fraudulent. The agent asks for my mailing address and I freeze, I ask them to pull this from my credit report because I don't feel comfortable giving an unknown company my physical address. They again become vocally agitated and asks for me to provide. I tell them no. They accuse me of not allowing them to speak and said something inaudible before saying they will be transferring me. 

The interaction was very strange. Felt a bit like entrapment or gaslighting and I got off the phone and my hands were shaking. It was a very dehumanizing experience. As a XXXX woman who has worked in corporate finance her entire professional career I was taken aback and deeply concerned.

Oddly enough this account was closed back in 2018 and yet they were able to place a substantial charge without any sort of authorization or involvement on my end. I wonder if I was the only person impacted or if this was more common. Also I question the security of a company if they can charge a closed account. 

I called and confirmed this was a valid email ( not spam ). 

Thanks for investigating!

XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) hold time was 1hr 59mins This is an absurd hold time, how is this allowed as a business practice? 
2 XXXX answered at XXXX, he indicated he did not know the process to release funds for withdrawal, I asked for mgr. Placed on hold, XXXX came back and said to do card to bank transfer online via website, up to $ XXXX daily, takes 3-5 days to complete. 
3 ) I tried the above, error messages, process does not work 4 ) total call time : 2hrs 24 mins XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) hold time was 2hrs 38mins 2 ) XXXX answered at XXXX XXXX, she researched problem, turns out the card to bank transfer is not allowed in MN. Very helpful agent, she escalated, and received approval for me to withdraw XXXX on Friday as it takes 4 days for the request to be processed and the account opened due to security. XXXX also indicated I would need to go through the process again to obtain the remaining funds in the account. 
3 ) total call time : 3 hrs 10 mins XX/XX/XXXX 1 ) I went to my local credit union to complete transaction, DECLINED - see attached. 
2 ) I went to local us bank location, transaction DECLINED - see attached 3 ) 2hrs 15mins drive time/transaction time at 2 banks only to be declined XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) hold time was only 40 mins 2 ) XXXX answered at XXXX, he researched, finds prior reps request, agrees the card should be 'open ' for withdrawal. He also indicates the rep that was supposed to open the card had not done so, and he is trying to find her. More research will be done, and US Bank will call my cell today with resolution. XXXX indicates I can withdraw {$22000.00} when card becomes open 3 ) total call time : 1hr 7mins XX/XX/XXXX the day is done, I don't have my money, and have not heard from US BANK. 

XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) hold time was XXXX XXXX 2 ) XXXX is rep, she worked with XXXX  in escalation dept, who tells her money is available today with a XXXX max 3 ) XXXX , same rep, looks up info from prior notes : XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX important date, because I have tried to withdraw my money on that date, also without success. To the point I gave up, and used different money. 
4 ) total call time : 1hr 47mins XX/XX/XXXX 1 ) I went to my local credit union to complete transaction, DECLINED - see attached 2 ) 1 hr 10mins drive & transaction time at bank XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) hold time 1hr 58mins, until I had to hang up to take a work call XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at XXXX 1 ) after waiting 49min, it sounded as though someone came on the line, but nobody answered. Forced to call back, and start waiting again. 

XX/XX/XXXX called Reliacard at 1 ) hold time 56mins 2 ) XXXX is rep. She also is completely unaware of how to withdraw anything beyond daily limit. XXXX indicates the account was open on the XXXX, but I must not have taken action. Informed her of my declined receipt. She talked to mgmt again, they will submit the request again, however, XXXX indicates, its only a request, not a guaranty, the money should be accessible in 3 to 5 biz days. I ask how am I to find out, she said I have to look at the app or online each day to see if the limit was raised. I told her that was unacceptable, she said that is the process, no other options. 
3 ) total call time : 1hr 24mins 7 Calls to Reliacard made over 3 business days 12hrs 39mins total cell phone minutes for the same 7 calls ( NOT ACCEPTABLE ) Call log attached showing corresponding dates/times/length of calls. 

How is a consumer to spend nearly 13hrs with Reliacard and work a full time job? 

It is simply absurd to have to spend this much time trying to get in touch with a financial institution to resolve an issue. 

Please note, I went through a similar experience in XX/XX/XXXX with US Bank Reliacard, on this SAME account. At that time I was also unsuccessful in withdrawing the funds, and was forced to take a larger loan in connection with a large transaction. In XX/XX/XXXX, I also made many many calls. If I need to locate call records for that fiasco I can, however, the current situation speaks for the Reliacard account servicing problems.

Because of this, I had a monthly mortgage insurance payment of {$61.00}. Approximately one and a half years into the mortgage, I reached out to my lender, new rez, and asked how I would be able to have the insurance payment removed. They advised that if I were to pay {$400.00} for a new appraisal, and if my new appraisal demonstrated an LTV of less than 80 %, they will be able to remove the monthly insurance payment. I did the new appraisal in XX/XX/XXXX, which demonstrated a current LTV of 76 %. However my lender did not remove the monthly insurance payment, stating that it did not matter what the new LTV was, rather what the original LTV was, which was greater than 80 %. I explained that if that were the case, there was no point in doing a new appraisal, as there was no way to go back in time and lower the original LTV at the time of the loan orgination. I spoke several times to different customer service reps and explained that this was unfair as I was given incorrect information. I would never have paid the {$400.00} fee to do a new appraisal if there was no benefit of doing the appraisal if there was no chance to remove the monthly insurance payment. I contested the appraisal fee with my credit card company as I felt that this appraisal was done under false pretenses.

07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card,"I received an Electronic Statement from Synchrony Bank for my XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/2020 and opened the email the following morning, XX/XX/XXXX. I noticed the amount due was significantly higher than expected, so I logged into my online account and noticed I was charged an enormous amount of interest on purchases I was told would to be interest free. I was charged interest in the amount of {$1300.00} in XXXX and another {$72.00} in XXXX. I have paid the amount due on time each month according to the XXXX interest plan I believe I agreed to in the XXXX XXXX  store, where I recall specifically talking to a Synchrony Bank authorized employee onsite. This was shortly after XXXX XXXX first opened in XXXX, TX. 

I called Synchrony Bank XXXX for the first time at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/2020. I explained that I was unaware of and felt mislead by the terms applied to my account and asked for the interest to be reversed. I spoke to a manager named XXXX ( employee ID XXXX ) and she said there was nothing she could to do remove the interest because their policy states interest can not be reversed if the promotional period end date is over 30 days. The promotional period end date was evidently XX/XX/2020, just 3 days before I called. I explained that I am experiencing financial and economic hardships as a result of COVID-19 and I asked for grace, but I was again told "" No '' and that there was  nothing they could do to help me. 

I tried Synchrony Bank 's online chat and chatted with XXXX XXXX, who also said there was nothing he could do because of the terms being outside of 30 days. He gave me a different number to call XXXX, where I talked to XXXX. 

During my second call to Synchrony Bank, when talking to XXXX, I explained that I am experiencing financial and economic hardships as a result of COVID-19 and asked for the interest to be reversed and interest free timeframe to be extended but she also said because the promotional period was over 30 days and I was calling 33 days after, that there was nothing she could do. She did not offer any compromise or payment plan option and yet kept saying they were there to help and if I had called earlier they could have extended the interest free payment terms through their COVID relief efforts. 

I called a 3rd time and spoke to XXXX at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/2020 and asked if there was anything he can do to help me. I offered to pay my bill in full and asked if he could wave the interest, but again I was told there was nothing that could be done ... leaving me with an interest charge of {$1400.00} on a {$2800.00} purchase! This makes no sense. 

To date, I have not received any notification outside of my electronic statement about a delayed promotional interest rate being charged to my account. If I am able to provide you with copies of my statements, you will see there are two different types of promotional programs listed. I was not aware of this until combing through the statements today and I am not entirely sure I understand the difference, but I do know when I agreed to these payment terms it was because there was to be XXXX interest. I pay my bills on time and I have excellent credit. I do not have many credit cards and typically do not finance things like furniture purchase. I feel mislead by XXXX XXXX   and Synchrony Bank. I am appalled by the fact that Synchrony Bank is not willing to work with me on this and unwilling to provide a credit of the interest given the circumstances and my payment history. I very much do not want to destroy my credit history because of a misunderstanding that I feel ( especially during this time ) there should be a better way to resolve. I am willing to pay my bill in full right now as long as the interest charges are removed and any credit damage is restored.

07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"On XX/XX/2020 US Bank sent me a letter letting me know that they have elected to close my personal credit card and my business credit card. The only other information provided was the name and phone number of someone who worked there for more information. 

I called that number, and I was told that MONTHS AFTER i voluntarily chose to close my personal checking account, they chose to do a review, and because of that review, they have chosen to close my credit card accounts. I asked why they needed to close my credit card accounts, especially since there is nothing wrong or illegal in me closing my personal checking account. The individual who i talked with over the phone from US BANK said that that is all the information they are given, and if I wanted more information, I would need to mail the Office of the President, so I did. 

When i received a response from The Office of the President, a few weeks later, they reiterated the same information that I already knew. They said that they can't share what the review findings were, but that they are in their right to close any accounts they see fit because it is in my card member agreement for my credit cards. 

I have never been late, delinquent, or have missed payments. I still don't know why my accounts were closed, and it is frustrating to try and get an answer from US BANK. After this occured, a few weeks later I applied for a Business Credit Card, and was denied. Part of the reason was the following : "" Credit obligations with us have been delinquent ''.

My travel plans had to be cancelled due to Covid travel restrictions which should have resulted in a full refund according to the XXXX website refund information. When only a partial refund of {$83.00} was issued, I contacted my credit card company, Citi Cards, to begin the transaction dispute process regarding the additional {$100.00}. 

Citi Card began an investigation and on XX/XX/20 I received an electronic document indicating that Citi had been in correspondence with XXXX which resulted in them confirming that I was due an additional refund of {$100.00}, for which they had already begun to refund process. Citi stated 'If the new credit is not posted, we will reopen the investigation and continue working on your behalf to resolve the issue '. 

On XX/XX/20, after receiving no additional credit from XXXX and no additional information from Citi Card regarding their monitoring of the account or situation, I contacted them to inquire about the status of my dispute. I explained the correspondence I received and the commitment Citi had made to proactively monitor the account for the credit XXXX had confirmed with THEM was still due for the account. The agent was polite and kind and asked that I give it a little more time for them to work on it. 

Now I have received an electronic document XX/XX/20 that states the dispute was found 'not in my favor ' due to my correspondence being received after the requested response date. However, I do not see where anything was requested which was not provided. 

It is my opinion that I received this generic decline letter due to a lack of investigation regarding my case and a failure in due diligence to monitor my account as was promised in the XXXX correspondence. 

When I called in XXXX it was not to open a new dispute but rather to follow up on a dispute which was not being attended to by the credit card issuer. Additionally, the fact that I am only now receiving a notice of resolution indicates that my case was not resolved within the predetermined guidelines for billing disputes. 

I have been and continue to be, an exceptional customer. That being said, I expect exceptional service and have not until now had reason to feel that I was getting less than that from Citibank. I am requesting that this matter be re-reviewed and the {$100.00} credit be issued by Citi due to the company failing to follow up with the credit from XXXX.

We currently owe about {$270000.00}. Our home was just appraised for {$530000.00}. We want to refinance to take advantage of a better interest rate as well as getting rid of our PMI. This would save us over {$200.00} each month. We applied to refinance with Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation. The refinance was for a conventional loan that came out to about {$280000.00} after refinancing costs. My wife and I both make more money than we did when we first got the loan. It was originally a loan for {$250000.00} to purchase the home as a short sale, and {$50000.00} cash to make improvements. We have had this loan since XX/XX/XXXXand never have missed a payment or been late. We submitted our tax returns for two years. XX/XX/XXXXwe showed an income of {$96000.00} and XX/XX/XXXX we showed an income of {$100000.00}. I am an XXXX   XXXX  at a local XXXX XXXX XXXX and my wife owns  a XXXX XXXX. She has been in XXXX for 8 years and has shown a steady profit each year. She owned the XXXX when we got our original loan and we were approved based on her income and my income. Her XXXX  is seasonal. She earns most of her total annual income in the second half of the year and really makes most of it in the fourth quarter. We can prove this and have offered income statements from XX/XX/XXXXshowing the majority of the income coming in the latter part of the year. We have offered up evidence to show this is a trend year after year. Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation refuses to acknowledge her income on an annual basis and only will look at her current year income. Currently, she shows a net income of about {$13000.00}. She actually has earned more so far this year than last year to date. As someone that is on salary, Roundpoint is willing to acknowledge my annual income, but refuses to acknowledge my wife 's income as a XXXX  XXXX  owner. I feel their practice is discriminatory against XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXXowners   and I feel that they are discriminating against her specifically as a female XXXX owner. She deserves to be given credit for the success of her XXXX  after 8 years of proven financial success. Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation will not even give her a chance to show this track record. They have shut us down. I also am concerned that Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation is unfairly stopping us from gaining a better interest rate and allowing us to drop our PMI. It seems that they stand to lose money in the long run if we refinance, so they are using poor and discriminatory lending practices in order to stop us from saving money in order to keep their own financial standing. The simple fact is, my wife and I make more money now than when we first got our loan. This loan will decrease our monthly spending by more than {$200.00}. It makes no fiscal sense for Roundpoint to prevent us from refinancing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation,NC,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3778073

The rebuttal date was XX/XX/XXXX. 

In the complaint was detailed information that highlighted the fact that Shellpoint Mortgage is knowingly overcharging my tax escrow account and assessing anticipated figures that are entirely incorrect. In their statement Shellpoint said the following : "" Shellpoint completed an escrow analysis on XX/XX/XXXX, based on the anticipated hazard insurance payment of {$3400.00} and anticipated county tax installments of {$4900.00}, {$5100.00}, {$4800.00} and {$4900.00} ( totaling {$23000.00} for the upcoming yearly bills from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ). '' It should be noted that the alleged anticipated tax amount of {$23000.00} would represent an unprecedented 17.68 % increase over the previous year ( {$19000.00} ), which is undoubtedly incorrect. As explained in a letter from the City of XXXX  ( see attached "" City Response Regarding Taxes '' ), this is not possible unless there was something done to change the assessed values. I've lived at this address from 17+ years and my assessed value has been pretty stagnant. As proof, the attached history ( see attached "" XXXX XXXX XXXX_Tax History '' ) of my property over the past 7 years clearly shows the same assessed value since XXXX. Moreover, according to the city, the only way the assessed value can be changed is with a successful tax appeal, an improvement done to the parcel that would increase the value of the property determined by the Assessor, or a municipal wide revaluation ; none of which applies to my property. Therefore the alleged anticipated county taxes is completely made up and not justified in the city of XXXX.

InXX/XX/XXXX I had to terminate my assistants employment due to finding her stealing from me on my security cameras, come to find out one of the items that was stolen from me was my AT & T Universal Citibank Credit Card along with my XXXX XXXX and XXXX cards. For over a year and a half I have been attempting to get the fraudulent charges along with interest accrued reversed, as anyone can see with my spending history, that these charges were not made by me. Im highly disappointed and very frustrated with how Citibank has handled this as XXXX and XXXX immediately credited back the charges, realizing they were fraudulent. Citibank has passed me around most recently speaking with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX from their security department saying that the case is denied due to the fact I had authorized my assistant to use my card. When I did authorize her to us my card it was right after I had XXXX XXXX as well as XXXX XXXX resulting in a XX/XX/XXXXso I was unable to leave the house for my medication so at the time and only that time I did ask her to pick up my medicine. However, as I mentioned before when she was terminated she STOLE several credit cards and used them WITHOUT my permission causing these charges to be accrued. I was advised by XXXX in Citi Banks security department to contact Citibanks specialty team department as they take the time to truly research fraudulent charges. About 4 months ago I sent a written letter to them with all the documentation highlighting the charges and explaining my case and I have yet to hear back from anyone. Im anxious to get this account settled as the charges as well as the interest accrued has added up to roughly {$15000.00}. I have continued to make payments on the card as I did not want this situation to effect my credit score, after a year and a half of no answers I am hopeful you will be able to help me settle this.

08/02/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Days after setting up automated withdrawals with my initial loan servicer, the loan was transferred to the service of Flagstar. As a result, the automatic payment feature that I had just implemented ( please see attached autopay confirmation ) was interrupted. It would be more than four months before I realized that none of my mortgage payments had been withdrawn. I understand this is a long time without realizing withdrawals were not being made. But, a quick look at my credit history and its clear that the methods I used to ensure my bills were paid was successful. One hundred percent successful until this incident. 

This was, and still is, absolutely sickening to me. My biggest fear related to the home purchase was specifically being late on a payment and damaging my credit. And this is exactly the reason I set up automatic payments in the first place. To remove human error. To give me peace of mind. To know that I will never be late on any payment to a lender. That is also why my credit report and credit score are near perfect ( again, the only blemish being this issue with Flagstar ). Every single other account I have open currently has no record of any late payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX was the first time I was made aware that my automated monthly mortgage payments had not been processed. The situation was aggravated by a long period of time between closing and the date of the first payment. This concerned me, so I set up autopay with XXXX and scheduled the first payment well in advance of the due date. I did this specifically to protect myself against any possible problems that can occur when first initializing autopay. Additionally, and even though it would never be an issue, I established overdraft protection with my personal bank, XXXX XXXX. A week or two after setting up autopay with XXXX, I received a hard copy confirmation, via mail, verifying autopay was set up successfully. 

After receiving that letter, I was supremely confident that I had covered all my bases. I had done everything possible to ensure my mortgage payments would never be missed, late, or not received for any reason. Or, so I thought. There would be more than four months between me receiving the confirmation letter from XXXX and me to go through my junk mail. Somewhere in that pile of junk was a letter from a bank, of which I had never heard before, trying to get my attention with mentions of litigation, missed mortgage payments, debt collection agencies, foreclosure, and more.. After re-reading a few times, frantically combing through my bank statements ( still, I thought it was a misunderstanding ), I came to the understanding, for the very first time, that a new company ( XXXX XXXX ) had purchased my loan, that the service provider was now different, and with this change the new provider ( Flagstar Bank ) would now require that I go through the automated payment sign-up process again in order to continue them. To my knowledge, I didn't receive any phone or email messages letting me know there was any sort of issue or problem. Indeed, in late XX/XX/XXXX, two months after the first missed payment, I was approved for an auto loan. My credit was scrutinized during this process and came back with nothing that would suggest I was delinquent on my mortgage. 

Incredulous, I immediately called XXXX and spoke with a representative. I let them know my non-payment had nothing to do with insufficient funds, or any reason other than honest oversight and unfortunate coincidence. This was my first home purchase, and I was not aware that the first month is typically when these mortgages are purchased by other companies to be used as investment securities. I still would have assumed the automated payments would continue, but I would have been more vigilant over my bank statements to ensure the money was being automatically withdrawn. 

I was a wreck and the XXXX representative was fantastic that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and quickly relieved my concern and helped me make things right. Unfortunately, her calm dont worry about a thing, well take care of it right now, belied just how serious this situation was, and how it could haunt me for up to SEVEN YEARS!! As far as credit reporting and future loan opportunities are concerned, having a 90-day late mark on my history is potentially as troubling as having a personal bankruptcy. 

Unaware of the severity of the situation at the time, I ultimately paid the entire lump-sum to get current ( {$7000.00} ). I did not ask for any sort of accommodation or to enroll in payment plan installments as this was a technical issue, not a financial distress situation ( which I can prove and have offered to prove ). I also established autopay with Flagstar that same day and have been vigilantly overseeing payments to ensure this never happens again, which, from my credit report, shows clearly that it has not. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX. With mortgage rates reaching all-time lows, I reached out to my broker to inquire about refinancing as I was hoping to take advantage of the lowered interest rates. He informed me that an initial pre-verification showed that I would be approved for a 3.25 % interest rate. But he also informed me of a 90-day non-payment disclosure on my credit report from Flagstar. I was in disbelief upon hearing this. The missed payments were unquestionably due to a technical issue. The account was made current as soon as the error was discovered. And the person I spoke to made it seem as though no credit agencies had or would be contacted. 

I explained all the above to my mortgage broker. Unphased, he replied that because this was a technical issue, I should have no problem disputing it by calling or writing Flagstar, and that they would be able to remove it from my credit report. So, after speaking with my broker, I mailed a letter to Flagstar detailing the events and asking that they remove the 90-day non-payment from my credit report. I received a reply a few weeks later stating my request was denied. I was incredulous. My entire adult life making sure I kept an impeccable credit history, completely wiped away by one technical oversight.

Since then, I have placed four phone calls to Flagstar, waiting on hold for at least 30 minutes in all four instances, and have spoken with more than five separate agents. They all stated that since they tried to contact me, there was no fault on their end and they would not entertain the idea of removing this from my credit report. My latest phone calls were placed this past XXXX as I had been told from my mortgage broker that after one year, I may be able to call again to see if my credit report could be adjusted. The representatives at Flagstar continued to be uninterested in hearing my side of the story, or that is was even plausible that someone wouldnt receive mail or voicemails from them. What I found to be surprising and insulting was the refinancing offer from Flagstar in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX attached ) for a lower interest rate only to be told over the phone that I was ineligible for that offer due to the 90-day non-payment they refuse to remove.

This entire situation has been a nightmare and the fact that it could remain on my credit report for possibly seven years is incredibly distressing. I am clearly not someone with questionable credit or a questionable credit history. My credit is excellent, and my entire credit report is flawless up until Flagstar acquired the loan from XXXX and my automatic payments were no longer being accepted. This was in no way due to financial distress - which I was, and am more than willing, to prove - and my credit reflects this.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"FLAGSTAR BANK, FSB",CO,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/02/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3775152

2. Since I had an existing interest bearing IRA account with Citibank practically getting negative returns after fees, I decided to participate in this CD offer@ 2.5 % interest. 

3. My personal banker informed me she was unable to handle the transaction so I had to work with the branch bank president because it was offer from the retirement division of Citibank. As a customer of this institution wouldn't the president act as a fiduciary in this transaction? 

4. Late in the afternoon we went through an application about 7 pages first which seemed correct. After which he created an IRA transfer document with the dollar amount. I had to sign both these documents and be hurried out for closing of the bank. 

5. Assuming he took care of all the details I wrote the maturity date on the cover of the folder containing all the documents and filed it at home marked a personal calendar as a reminder when to move the funds 18 months later. 

6. I recently went to move the funds after 18 months only to discover he never established a CD at 2.5 % instead he failed to fill out the paperwork correctly and had it in an interest bearing account at .005 %. 

7. I tried every way to get this bank to remedy the problem and they refused because the incorrectly filled out transfer paper was a signed contract.

07/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I received a letter in the mail with an attached US Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card that was stated to replace my current US Bank Visa Platinum card. My current card does not expire until XX/XX/XXXX. The wording on the top of the letter states : "" Congratulations, your account has been upgraded to a new U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card . '' For clarity, I intentionally do not carry a rewards card as I am familiar with interchange fees and try to consider my small, local businesses whenever possible. I am also employed by, and work very closely with, a small business owner. I see exactly how much extra money goes out due to processing rewards cards vs. regular credit cards. 

When I called US Bank to figure out what was happening, I got several responses ranging from "" Your current card is no longer offered '' ( It is currently advertised on their website ) to "" We do automatic upgrades for cards that have been inactive for 2-5 months '' ( My last activity on the card was a purchase on XX/XX/XXXX for {$970.00}, a purchase on XX/XX/XXXX for {$94.00}, and a purchase on XX/XX/XXXX for {$67.00}. These were all paid off within two weeks of the purchase date and none fulfill the claim of 2-5 months of inactivity. 

When I asked if I could simply not use the new card for the reasons stated above, I was told that the change affected the account and not the card itself. So, while I received no communication, submitted no request, and gave no approval or permission, my current card was changed to a rewards card in early XXXX. When I asked them to simply change it back, I was told that it wasn't possible to change back, and I would have to close the account and re-apply. I was later told by the manager at the call center that the product services department usually ran offers 2-3 months after automatic upgrade campaigns to downgrade cards back to their original status. I was also told by the same manager that the campaign affected around 5200 customers after being told by a previous employee that it affected 52,244 customers. When I pressed to get in touch with someone who could change my account status I was told that no one above her takes calls from customers and that I was free to fax or write them my questions/requests. 

I felt like this situation was relatively ridiculous considering my end goal was simply to keep the card I had. When looked at ethically, it becomes more questionable on the larger scale. It is reminiscent of the XXXX XXXX scandal in recent memory. Especially when you consider the lack of communication or input from the customer side.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,OH,431XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/30/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3772038

07/28/20,Debt collection,Medical debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I recently reviewed my credit report to find I had 1 account in collections for an old hospital visit. The collection agency is First Federal Credit Control and the amount owed was {$700.00}. I never received any statement or invoice in the mail or email from them. 

I immediately called this company to see how I could take care of this bill to remove it from my credit report. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020. He proceeded to tell me that I could not pay less than the {$700.00} because the hospital could not take less than that. He also told me there were several other accounts in collections with them that had smaller amounts that were also affecting my credit score.

After researching, the accounts that I paid off that day ( for a total amount of {$450.00} ) were not on my credit report, and the only outstanding balance in collections is still the {$700.00}. 

I called again today ( XX/XX/2020 ) to ask if I could pay off the account. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. I first let her know that XXXX had lied to me on my call with him about the accounts and how he gave me incorrect advise. She immediately began speaking over me, berating anything I tried to say, and would not let me get a word in. 

This company is is very abusive to callers, lying to consumers, and are rude to the point of me having to hang up because I could not finish a sentence.

The matter seemed to have been dealt with and removed from my credit report. 

Once again XXXX XXXX and Skagit Bonded Collector 's have reared their ugly heads and turned this debt over for collections again with the knowledge that this debt has been written off in Bankruptcy. Once again, I have emailed both of them and followed up with a written correspondence and went as far to call someone at Skagit Bonded Collector 's, but the debt is clearly on my credit report again. This is illegal and both these companies know this. Maybe they are trying to cause problems knowing that with the COVID situation that I am unable to resolve this issue by going to court myself. 

I have in my posession a collection letter from XX/XX/XXXX trying to collect this debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX as well, I have a new letter from XX/XX/XXXX trying once again to collect this debt.

This gives the appearance that I have maxed out my Citi credit card. There is no explanation for this. I got this card last year after receiving a promotion in the mail for an interest free balance transfer. The only charge to this card was the balance transfer, which was about 30 % of the total limit they offered. My limit was {$9200.00}. I have not charged anything additional to this card. I try to keep my credit utilization under 30 %. I have never missed a payment and always pay more then the minimum balance. There is no reason for Citi to have reduced the credit limit, which will cause my score to decrease significantly. This will have a tremendous negative impact on my credit. The country is in a financial crisis due to COVID and I have done everything right. Thankfully, I still have my job.The same job I have had for almost 14 years. I have paid all my bills on time and have a 100 % on-time score. Ive never been late on any of my credit payments and have not asked for any kind of COVID forbearance. I do not know why they would treat their customers like this during such a trying time. Its going to ruin my credit. I just want them to increase the limit back to what it was. I have no plans of jacking the card up to the limit. I will even agree to not charge anything additional if that is what they are worried about if they will just increase the limit back to where it was so that it doesnt look like I maxed out a credit card.

I have also been subjected to repeated delays whereas my information is regularly submitted for the wrong amount or wrong loan product. Lastly, the company is attempting to re run my credit report after already charging me for a credit report and providing a copy of that report from XX/XX/2020. The lender is stating that the wrong social security number was entered into the system and another credit report needs to be run when that is not correct. 

A XXXX XXXX  IRRL does not require a credit report whatsoever and the fees should be less due to the lower processing. This lender is doing whatever it can, attempting to charge premium fees and costs for less favorable rates while the market rates continue to decline to discourage my VA IRRL application. for example, a rate quote of 4 % with nearly {$7000.00} in closing costs is both higher than my current rate and not allowable whereas an IRRL requires a rate reduction of at least .5 % as well and costs that do not exceed 36 months recoupment period. I have been quoted less favorable rates and fees of {$6000.00} - {$11000.00} which are significantly above the allowed limits and current market competition with suggestions to steer me into a full VA loan.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,WA,982XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/29/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3769317

07/27/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"My mortgage was transferred to XXXX/LoanCare XX/XX/19. My prior mortgage company was collecting and paying my hazard insurance. My insurance carrier ( XXXX ) sent me confirmation that my loan company was changed to Loan Care on XX/XX/19 along with the current premium that was due. It was my understanding that the new mortgage company would pay the bill since they had the funds in escrow. I received communication from the mortgage company that they were going to place hazard insurance under them on my home followed by letters dated XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19 that the policy 's placed by them had been cancelled which led me to believe they had made the payment to XXXX as they were supposed to per my arrangement with my prior mortgage company. On XX/XX/19 they withdrew {$1400.00} from my escrow account to pay for coverage they placed on my property. I immediately contacted XXXX to find out they had failed to pay my policy and coverage had been cancelled. Upon discovering this, I immediately purchased insurance for my property and informed the mortgage company I had done so. Unfortunately due to their failure to pay my policy, I had a lapse in coverage. XXXX/LoanCare took it upon themselves to charge me for this lapse. As it was their responsibility and failure to pay my insurance, I do not believe I should be paying for this. I believe they owe me {$270.00} as only {$1100.00} of the {$1400.00} was refunded to my escrow account. I have attempted to address this with them on 2 occasions both of which took hours on the phone. I was led to believe the error would be resolved and I would be refunded. I have reviewed all of my mortgage statements and no refund has been issued for this. I believe my money was mishandled by the mortgage company and it is frustrating that I have no choice in who is managing my money that they feel they can spend my money in ways that have not been approved by me. They were given notification of my insurance being due and had ample opportunity to pay for it. They failed to do so and also FAILED to tell me that they had missed the deadline for payment and that I needed to resolve this with XXXX.

Due to the pandemic I became behind on one of credit cards with the Pen Fed. I contacted Pen Fed and was told that my HELOC was in jeopardy of closing if a payment wasn't made that day. I made the requested payment to keep my HELOC open and not negatively impact my credit score. 
Despite the agreement the HELOC was closed anyway. I called the bank and was told that a supervisor would look into the matter. I called several times and was told the same thing. Then today, XX/XX/XXXX I called and was told that the HELOC was closed due to my credit score dropping. The loan is a secured loan and after reading all of disclosures no where is it stated that the account can be closed due to credit score. It does state that the credit union has a right to freeze the account for non payment. But this was not the case. 
The credit union made a verbal agreement to keep the account open but not only did they renege on that agreement that closed the account for reasons that were not part of the disclosures documents when the HELOC was opened.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,PENTAGON FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,NY,112XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3767796

Furthermore - When I log into my citi account, there is NO mention or reference to any card OTHER than the one ending in XXXX. 

When I spoke to a customer service representative, they said oh this other card isn't registered online. Well, there is no way for a customer to register a card online. 

When you have a banking relationship - all of your accounts should be loaded onto that servicing platform. 

This seems like a very deceptive banking practice. I do not owe an annual fee on a card that I not only havent used but requested that only XXXX be left open. 

I have an outstanding credit left on this card ... this card has a {$450.00} a year fee - why am i also being charged another XXXX fee on a ghost account?

07/30/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Incorrect information on your report,None,"Summary : This is a complaint regarding our Loancare Account against our VA mortgage loan servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the sub-servicer Loancare XXXX  Services XXXX to correct their error in failing to report our payments made for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 to all the consumer reporting agencies : XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX. Because of their failure to report that these payments were made to all the credit reporting agencies, our credit reports all show "" NO DATA '' or "" UNKNOWN '' for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, thus missing payments in our Payment History on all our consumer credit reports. This is not only damaging our credit, but it is also preventing us from refinancing our VA home mortgage since other lenders will not work with us due to these discrepancies, which appears to be delinquency. Therefore, we are demanding that our loan servicer immediately correct these errors by reporting payments were in fact made for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 in order to reflect in Payment History section with all the consumer credit reporting agencies. 
Dispute : Consumer Credit Reporting Errors They failed to report XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 payments our loan servicer erroneously reported to all 3 consumer credit reporting agencies that our Loancare Account was in forbearance, when in fact our Loancare Account was NEVER in forbearance. Further, they failed to report that payments were made to Loancare for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020. Therefore XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  are all reporting on our credit reports showing the following : In PAYMENT HISTORY Section Since they failed to report payments made for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020, the consumer credit reporting agencies all show missed payments for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX also known as UNKNOWN and DATA UNAVAILABLE leaving those months blank in Payment History. 
Explanation of Dispute OUR LOANCARE ACCOUNT WAS NEVER IN FORBEARANCE, therefore, all payments made for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 needs to be reported to all the consumer reporting agencies to reflect on all our credit reports. On XX/XX/2020, we submitted a request for forbearance in error. However, the next day on XX/XX/2020, we contacted our loan servicer via phone and email and cancelled the forbearance request ( we have an Acknowledgment Confirmation Ticket # XXXX emailed from our loan servicer ). In addition, on XX/XX/2020, we submitted another follow up email to confirm that the forbearance was cancelled ( we have an Acknowledgment Confirmation Ticket # XXXX emailed from our loan servicer ). Therefore, our Loancare Account was never in forbearance and payments made in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 needs to be reported to all the consumer credit reporting agencies. 
CORRECT ERRORS IMMEDIATELY BY REPORTING PAYMENTS MADE FOR XXXX, XXXX AND XX/XX/2020 : We are currently trying to obtain a business loan and refinance our home mortgage ; however, due to our loan servicers error by incorrectly reporting that our Loancare account was in forbearance and further FAILING to report payments made for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020, this has prevented us from working with other lenders. We are demanding that our loan servicer immediately correct their error by reporting our payment history for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 payments to all 3 consumer credit reporting agencies : XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX to reflect on credit reports.

The letter also stated that this refund was sent to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Again, I closed this account, but if theres funds leftover in it now, then I want my XXXX funds! By the time, so had gotten the letter, their call center was about to close. HOWEVER ... I still called just to see if I could some assistance, but no. Their automated voice bot makes you go through their menu and then while waiting on hold, this bot has the audacity to tell customers to solve our issues online through Netspends website due to the lack of customer support because of COVID-19. So, I sent an email. ( Spoiler alert : I still got no help ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I finally got a response to my email that I sent yesterday to customer service, and Ill attach a screenshot that shows that customer service just gave me the run around by informing me to contact their support line because theyre unable to help me via email due to data concerns and other XXXX. Yet, their automated voice bot on the support line tells customers to go online and solve our issues ourselves. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I file a complaint to Consumer Finance to let them know that Netspend is using the pandemic as an excuse to avoid helping their customers with their financial problems during a pandemic.

08/03/20,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Issues began at the beginning of this loan during the month of XXXX when I called to make sure I wasn't late on my first payment as I received a harassing call at my place of work indicating my account was past due. Please keep in mind I had just purchased this RV. When I called M & T to discuss this inappropriate phone call, they indicated their records reflected I had two RV loans with different payment amounts. They said this would be resolved and my payment was not due yet ... .they apologized for calling my work. I then made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Then when I applied for a mortgage in XXXX and the mortgage officer indicated I was denied because M & T bank had reported I had not made payments to them although I called and made one on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called M & T Bank, they indicated they did not have the correct bank account number so the payment did not go through, however, no one notified me of this issue. Payments are being taken out of my account without authorization. For two separate months, two payments have been taken out on the same day. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$420.00} was taken out of my personal bank account twice making a total of {$850.00}. My payment is only {$210.00} and I was actually making two payments, one for XXXX and XXXX. Instead, they took out {$850.00}, only returned {$420.00} which was confirmed by my bank, and have not credited my account for the initial {$420.00}. In my view this is stealing. My bank gave you {$420.00}, confirmed it and they are acting as though they never received it which is incorrect. They indicated I have not made a payment, whereas my bank confirms they have received my money. Therefore, monies I have paid have not been applied to my account and I'm receiving threatening correspondence every month indicating I'm 50 days past due which is inaccurate as reflected on my account statement. In XXXX, again, two charges on the same day but for different amounts were taken from my personal bank account which I did not authorize. I made a payment of {$220.00}, however, not only did they take the amount of {$220.00} but they also took the amount of {$210.00}. I reported this to them several times and nothing has been done. I have also attached collection letters dated 9 days apart stating different things which make no sense whatsoever. I have received multiple collection calls although I am not behind in my payments. I was told this would be taken care of several months ago and now there seems to be no resolution as I can't seem to get anyone to return my call. Additionally, I am unable to obtain any copies of statements off my account online even though it says they have them for the last seven years. Mine stop at XXXX and I am unable to reach anyone to obtain copies.

In addition set up automatic payment plans with confirmation I.D . numbers as follows : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Spoke with agent XXXX on XXXX, spoke with XXXX on XXXX, XXXX from member hardship I.D . XXXX whom had a negative attitude. 

Essentially, other additional months ensued before some actions were taken because at the time of said arrangements, I believed they were in motion, much to my chagrin arrangements were not honored two months later. This resulted in several expensive fees on credit card accounts however one account remained in an arranged payment status, which is why it was baffling that, U.S.A.A did not answer my many request to alleviate these problems.

08/01/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Consumer Complaint Date XX/XX/XXXX Re : Consumer Complaint against Freedom Mortgage Mortgage Loan # XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Property ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX Attn : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
To whom it may concern, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, am filing a complaint against Mortgage Servicer, Freedom Mortgage for several reasons that include false credit reporting placing my livelihood and home in jeopardy, and mismanagement of the loan associated with my primary residence XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ca. XXXX. 
Background, I purchased my home in XXXX and had an FHA mortgage through XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX transferred the loan to Freedom Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, it was the same month I had to file for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy due to medical ills and loss of income. 
The problem with Freedom Mortgage began in XX/XX/XXXX when the denied me access to my account online and refused to speak with me regarding my loan stating they could not due to the bankruptcy unless my bankruptcy attorney sent them a letter indicating that it was appropriate to continue to speak with me and allow me access to my mortgage. Although, Freedom Mortgage did not accept the attorneys request and did not allow access. 
Moreover, in XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit A ) Freedom Mortgage filed a petition to include the hoe in bankruptcy because of arrears. However, they could not provide documentation to the trustee and in fact, the petition Freedom Mortgage filed showed a surplus of funds in escrow. The Trustee denied their request, and the property was exempted from the Chapter XXXX filing. 
Again, in XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit B ), Freedom Mortgage filed a past due amount of {$650.00} stating fees associated with the bankruptcy. However, there were no arrears noted in the petition. 
Additionally, Freedom Mortgage discontinued reporting my loan to the credit bureaus and began sending erroneous statements indicating unrecognizable amounts owed. Regardless, I continued to pay my monthly mortgage payments. 
Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, and I was able to pay off my Chapter XXXX creditors and was successfully discharged. I called Freedom Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX to ask them to allow me access to my online banking as well as begin showing property monthly statements. At which, time they said that I was behind by {$8800.00}. I went ahead and sent a check just so I would be up to date until I could resolve the discrepancy. However, after thirty days went by and the check wasnt cashed, I called Freedom Mortgage again and they stated they never received the check. Therefore, I sent {$10000.00} XXXX XXXX. 
However, after repeatedly asking them for proof of arrears with no response, I sent a letter in XX/XX/XXXX, showing my payment history with supporting bank statements. I received a reply from Freedom Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit C, ) indicating that they received my letter and would respond within 30 days. They never did respond. 
However, they did begin reporting to XXXX credit Bureau showing 180 days late. This devastated my credit score, even as I was beginning to recover from the bankruptcy. 
At any rate, I contained to contact them and to no avail. They sent me two accounting reconciliation reports that show payments reflect against arrears but the statement to not support my payment history. For instance, they show a XX/XX/XXXX payment was applied to a XX/XX/XXXX bill, yet there should be no arrears in XXXX. 
Finally, in XXXX I phoned again, asking why my statements continue to reflect late payments, and rather than addressing my call, they sent me a demand letter on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have spent months trying to resolve this with Freedom Mortgage and yet their behavior and negligence is egregious. My credit score is ruined, and now they want to foreclose on my home. 
I appreciate your assistance with this matter and welcome a letter from you to Freedom Mortgage asking for their compliance with these requests and to resolve this matter. 
The most egregious is the fact that they have inappropriately reported false information to credit bureaus damaging my credit just as I was successfully discharged from Chapter XXXX bankruptcy.

On XX/XX/XXXX my credit card was denied. I went online to my account and saw faudulent charges to XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX two a charge for XXXX and a charge for XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX separate charges XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Fraudulent charges totaled 14, XXXX I immediately reported this activity to citicard, account was closed and I was told I would not be responsible for fraudulent activity. I NEVER recieved even 1 alert about these highly suspicious charges. I never use my credit card for any purchases like this. In addition citi card allowed my account to go XXXX over my limit. This was again a big red flag. Only when I called them on XX/XX/XXXX did they realize the fraudulent activity. On all my credit cards I get alerts for much less suspicious activity. My son is an authorized user on this card and was about to close on a mortgage. When this showed up on his credit the mortgage company said it affected his credit rating. I am the primary on the card, took him off the card but it caused his credit rating to go below the accepted level for the mortgage. He is still hoping to close. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX the security supervisor at Citicard on XX/XX/2020 only to find out that the investigation had not even started and could take 90 days before they remove the charges. I need to get my credit repaired asap. 
Citicard failed to id these fraudulent acitivities and now I am still waiting over 1 month later for the charges to be removed from my charge. XXXX said it could take 45 days for the merchant to give an explanation. THis makes no sense. Their negligence is causing my son to possibly lose his loan. XXXX XXXX can be reached at XXXX My credit score dropped significantly. I need these charges removed so I can contact the credit bureau. I also sent a letter to Citicard XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX S. Dakota XXXX as advised by XXXX XXXX, the security supervisor.

My bank account was debited the {$2100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Barclays bank XXXX mastercard only credited {$21.00} on my statement as the payment made. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX Mastercard saying that I had shortpaid my account and my account needed immediate attention. I called them right away and discovered their error. The man I spoke with gave me a case number XXXX. 
He was to forward this information along with the copy of my check to the investigation team who would correct the error right away. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called into the customer service department who advised me that they would not be processing any paperwork on my account for at least 2 billing cycles. I explained that this was unacceptable as I have paid the funds from my account which is no longer their and I do not have the credit applied to my statement. Waiting 60-90 days for a response seems highly unethical and against what any reasonable person should expect to endure. I was told that the call would be escalated and I would hear from a manager in a few days. They also gave me a fax number to send my inquiry to as well as a mailing address to which I have expressed by concern and disappointment in how I was being treated as a customer. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called in for a status update and spoke to a person who was struggling to communicate in English however managed to express that they once again would not be responding to the investigation to at least 2 more billing cycles. 

I believe that as a consumer this is horrible practice. If we the consumers had not made timely payments we would be punished with derrogatory remarks and poor credit reporting history, however when these banks act badly and against the consumer they seems to get away with it with impunity. I have never missed a payment and I am a good and loyal customer however I am being treated unfairly and unethically as they are hiding behind a massive corporate structure and refuse to correct my account and their error for an unreasonable amount of time if they correct it at all. In essence they have stolen my money and refuse to either provide a credit to my account nor return it. Waiting 60-90 days for an expected response is unreasonable and I formally request that the CFPB investigate and request some answers.

08/07/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We have our Mortgage through Lakeview Loan Servicing XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, VA XXXX. We have an escrow account set up with them that holds our money for taxes. Our current county XXXX County in Texas separated mine and my husbands tax acct because at the time of our filing last year we were not married. ( Supposedly it's a process the tax office does ). They sent both my Husband XXXX XXXX and My statements to the Mortgage company to be paid. My husbands was paid but mine was not. We received notice of this in XX/XX/2020 when Taxes weren't paid on the property fully. We called our Mortgage company to make them aware. We had to send in documentation of the statement and they said they would take care of it and get it paid. We then went to the tax office to verify our standing with them so a lien would not be put on the house. We received another letter of an outstanding balance in XXXX and called the Mortgage company again to be told that they had the info, they were working on it but with COVID they were experiencing less staffed workers so it would take some time. Then again in XXXX, same thing. Called them and they said it's a process and it takes time. By XXXX we received the same thing. Called and again same thing with them. By XXXX my husband was working with another company and lady to refinance our home to get our interest rate lowered so our payment could be lowered. When it came to the beginning of XXXX she told us that our taxes on the property were outstanding and that in order to refinance with her we would need to pay them. Mind you in XXXX I was reassured that we would not be responsible for any penalties associated with unpaid taxes as it was not our fault they were not paid because we have an escrow acct set up to pay these for the property. Next part is going to have to be a long story short. I got a letter and another outstanding bill that taxes weren't paid and now a lawyer was representing the county against me. Needless to say our penalty fees at this time had accrued well past {$1000.00}. I called and was on the phone 10 hours total between 2 days with the mortgage company for multiple people to tell me that those taxes would not be paid due to the statement being in my name and I was not on the loan only on the deed. I explained to them that that information was incorrect. It does not matter who the name is on the statement is, all that matters is that those taxes are due on that property that they hold the mortgage to and that an escrow acct is set up for. Multiple times I was told this and told there was nothing more they could do and hung up on. I kept calling back and each person I spoke with told me the same thing. I then paid the taxes myself so that I would not accrue any more fees and that my brand new house would not have a lien on it due to nothing of my fault! I then called back the next day and argued with more rude representatives that tried to also explain to me that they will only pay one tax bill and they already paid my husbands so they won't be paying anymore which to what my response was, you don't get to decide the amount of taxes that are due on a property, you pay the bills that are associated with the account you hold. I then finally was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX ID # XXXX who was actually the most helpful rep I spoke to. He tried to tell me the same line of XXXX that they wouldn't pay it if my name was on the bill. I then explained to him what I said earlier and he then asked me to hold. I told him that I was filing a complaint with the CFPB and they told me that they were in the wrong and that this is a default on their part and that if I could allow them 7-10 days and they would get it taken care of. They did send me a check and it was {$500.00} short for the penalty fees they owed me for paying. Spent another 3 hours on the phone arguing with them because the escrow analysis I requested showed different from what the supervisor kept trying to tell me it was. Now we found a discrepancy with our escrow analysis and was told we needed to talk to a different department. Was hung up on again and now the number they gave us for the department we supposedly need to speak with does not go through. I am in the middle of all this chaos and was suggested to file a complaint. I would like to take legal action against them and just wanted this complaint filed and more advice of where to go from here because now I am unable to refinance and not be with their company anymore.

07/28/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"XX/XX/XXXX My history with CitiBank dates back to one of the first lines of credit that I opened in college and has extended nearly twenty years. At present, there is one current account with Citi, which is the subject of this e-mail. 

From the beginning of our interactions with Citi on this account, we have received erratic confirmation e-mails ( if any ) and poor reporting on payments made to this account. During the course of XXXX, we made thirteen payments of a total of {$2000.00}. Because of payment processing problems on Citis end ( Citis systems failed to process payments we authorized through Citis website ), and time delayed timeline to notify us of those missed payments, those payments were sometimes placed at odd times. The longest time between those payments was 55 days. Corrective action and payments were made and reauthorized immediately each time we were notified that authorized payments were not reflected on our account. 

There were at least three periods where payments were authorized and not removed from our account that have been documented : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. During this period, Citi did not send any notifications except mail on normal billing cycles to confirm payments, which often lagged. Because of the extreme lag on Citi statements, it would sometimes not become apparent that payments had not been credited to our account, despite our authorization, for two billing periods. 

- We caught the payment not going through in XXXX and reauthorized a payment on XXXX XXXX. 
- The XXXX payment was authorized, but did not go through, so two payments were made in XX/XX/XXXX. 
- Our XXXX payment was scheduled, but was removed earlier than authorized on XX/XX/XXXX and so two payments were applied to XXXX rather than one in XXXX and one in XXXX. 
- Our XXXX payment was authorized, but it did not show up that it had not been removed until XXXX, when two catch-up payments were made ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). A third payment was made in XXXX, and after speaking with a Citi representative, who enrolled us in autopay and gave us a {$10.00} credit for the repeated problems with Citis payment processing software. 
- At no time was any payment processed by Citi rejected by our bank, and at no time did we have insufficient funds to cover the payments authorized and made through XXXX website. 

A summary : - All payments significantly exceeded minimum payments required. 
- The longest period without a payment was 55 days. That lag in payment stemmed directly from notification delays on Citis end. 
- In XXXX, CitiBank employees credited our account additional and apologized for the inconvenience, acknowledging multiple problems with XXXX payment systems. 

At this point, we believed that the problem was behind us and the auto payment feature would ensure that no additional problems would occur ; however, - In XXXX, Citi reported to credit reporting agencies, in error, that we were 60 days delinquent in our accounts in XXXX and XXXX, which was actually impossible. 
- Citi reduced the credit line on the account from {$9100.00} to {$5600.00}. 
- The impact on my FICO score from the erroneous reporting was significant, ultimately dropping my credit score to XXXX, a fact that we did not find out until well into XXXX. 
- The continued denial of any CitiBank problems and the banks refusal to remove the erroneous report, continue to harm credit scores it was dropped 55 points today after CitiBank again denied any wrong-doing. 

Since finding this error during a normal credit check, we have had more than 10 conversations with Citi employees in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX, and written two letters in XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. Through each of these phone conversations, including extended phone conversations on XX/XX/XXXX ( with XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( with XXXX ), we were assured that Citis payment and auto payment systems had significant problems through XXXX and that Citi knew of its multiple problems and would correct the errors in credit reporting. Further, it was confirmed that all notifications on payment-related issues had been disabled by Citi without warning or notification. 

Citis customer service team repeatedly acknowledged problems with CitiBanks payment processing systems and consistently assured us that the erroneous report would be removed from my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX suggested that I call back in a few days, when she expected that Citi would be resolve the problem by correcting the erroneous credit reporting information by showing no delinquent payments related to our account since it opened. Each conversation was cordial and efficient, assuring us that the situation was an error and would be resolved. 

Following the XX/XX/XXXX call, I had additionally reported through XXXX  that the credit report of being 60 days delinquent was made in error, and that, according to Citis own records, our accounts were not late due to Citis own system errors. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I placed a call received by someone identifying herself as XXXX, who refused to speak with me, saying all future communications on the account would need to be in writing something we had never been told previously. I requested to be put in touch with a supervisor, which she refused before hanging up on me. When I called back, I spoke with a representative named XXXX, who promptly put me through to a supervisor, XXXX. XXXX put me on hold for 40 minutes before being disconnected without speaking with him beyond a curt Hello. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and spoke with a representative named XXXX, who stated that all communication must happen in writing, prompting this letter. 

Following that conversation, we wrote a letter, as instructed, outlining this situation. Nearly a month later, we received a letter stating that they needed more information, which we provided in a timely manner, before sending a letter on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that CitiBank is again refusing to make corrections and now refuses to acknowledge any errors. 

At this point, my wife and I have invested more than 12 hours in attempting to resolve issues that stem from CitiBanks systematic payment processing errors and a lack of timely notification when errors did occur, directly causing payment delays. Despite Citis errors, we worked quickly to correct errors and make payments as soon as we were notified. Those delays never exceeded 55 days, despite having to sometimes wait two written billing cycles before finding CitiBanks errors. 

Payments were authorized on our end each month in a timely manner through Citis systems that exceeded minimum payments. 

The on-going credit reporting error continues to cause significant harm.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,190XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3767137

I have already made a disput with all 3 credit bureaus and received an email from them that they are unable to remove the late payment from my history.

I have my loan documents from when I purchased the home, including my Amortization Schedule, which shows the monthly PMI amount, which does not total what they took and supposedly paid out for my PMI once my loan was paid off.

My loan documents amortization schedule clearly show that the amount for PMI for the year of XXXX totals $ 788.28.They directed my {$100.00} payoff overage and put it into my escrow account to payout more than was owed towards my annual USDA PMI and sent me a check back for a lesser amount than I am actually owed.

07/24/20,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"Dear customer service or complaint office : To whom it may concern : Today is Friday, XX/XX/XXXX This last XXXX, almost XXXX I entered into a deal with XXXX XXXX in being led to buy a XXXX convertible  through a man that I met in my home town that hired me to help him at his house with various jobs concerning his business XXXX XXXX in XXXX  XXXX. I did not know at the time that he had filed bankruptcy with the business or was a known liar and a XXXX. I have had my XXXX XXXX   for over 28 years in this XXXX Iowa area in XXXX  and he contacted me to help him with fixing his credit and wanted to hire me to do XXXX work at his home in XXXX XXXX near XXXX XXXX. I agreed to work with him on a temporary basis for a couple of weeks during which time he wanted to get a very expensive car thru a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. The car was the said XXXX and he introduced me to his bank : XXXX XXXX  @ XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. in the XXXX XXXX area. The managers name there was XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me in front of XXXX that he had a {$30000.00} CD to cover the expense of the car if he got it.

We went to XXXX XXXX to test drive the car and the bottom line is he talked me into signing the paper work for the car because he planned on paying me back completely or paying off the car with the CD within a week but we had to originate the loan and the only bank that offered us the loan was Wells Fargo and the dealership was very excited and pushy and tried to get us to get it DONE on the spot and XXXX XXXX was very intense and said to all of us "" Oh no problem we will get it done, get it done asap and i'll pay you out of my CD!!! He bragged about everyone he knew in town that was in business and he promoted XXXX   XXXX  to other businesses that he knew in town, he was grooming me to get his trust and his confidence and friendship and he was a wolf in sheeps clothing to me! 
The bottom line is he presented himself to me as an honorable guy and took advantage of my innocence and generosity. I trusted him to pay me back and during the time I was working for him from XXXX XXXX until the second week in XXXX right before everything started shutting down because of Covid he was promising me he would re write the loan thru his bank against his {$30000.00} CD. 
Well I went with him to his bank then they said they were going to close his account and when I got to the dealership and told them about it they said they did not want to deal with XXXX XXXX and I had already signed the paperwork ... .and when I told and explained it all to the bank they agreed with me that it WAS INDEED A STRAW purchase and fraud on his account. 
I will try to send you the supporting documents from E MAILS that we have done back and forth.. ..that is Wells Fargo executive offices ... they said that they were going to rewind the loan for sure with the dealership for sure in supporting e mails. thanks. 




FROM : XXXX Case # XXXX MonXXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX  to me, AND XXXX Note to you AT CFPB This is one of the first letter the executive offices sent to me! 

XXXX, I have submitted this up to an escalated management team for review as I agree with you and want to continue to advocate for the outcome we are hoping for. As of right now, they are still currently reviewing the case and will give me an update when there is one available. As soon as I get one, I will give you a call. I appreciate your continued patience. I will do my best to continue to assist you. Thank you. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX offices Wells Fargo next e mail :!!! 




XXXX Tue, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX to me XXXX, I have great news. The escalation team has agreed to yours and Is request for the unwind. I am going to reach out to the dealership to get that process started. Please be ready for a call from me and or possibly the dealership in regards to setting up the return of the vehicle. I will reach out once I have gotten the process started. 



Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX Executive Office Case Specialist II Executive Office Auto Wells Fargo Auto | XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX | XXXX, MN XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX From : XXXX XXXX XXXX Sent : Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - **** note : Clearly the Bank has agreed to RE WIND THE LOAN with the dealership here!! Then I got this e mail from them a few weeks later.. .. 
I have supporting documentation also that they would for SURE do it becasue XXXX gave me paperwork on it that he was going to pay me on it at the attorney XXXX XXXX office in XXXX XXXX for the car. 
HERE is the next e mails :!!! thank you. 





XXXX Tue, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  to me XXXX, At this time, please just continue to be patient. I am working diligently with my management team and the dealership to get this process done correctly. I will follow up as soon as I have some direction. Thank you. 



ello XXXX, I cant speak for everyone up here in Minnesota, but I do know that for the most part we are all trying to abide by the governors stay at home requests to try to limit this epidemics effect. 



In terms of how long this may take, I unfortunately do not have a timeline. Your case has been escalated up to 2 levels above myself as an outlying case I felt needed additional review. I can only provide you updates as I get them. I assure you, as soon as I get one, you will be my next immediate call. 



If Mr. XXXX is willing to take over the vehicle, he would need to apply for a loan to purchase it from you. It does not need to be through Wells Fargo, as it can be through any financial institution. Alternatively he can purchase it outright from you via cash or check that you can use to pay the loan off and then sign the title over to him. Based off our previous conversations, it does not seem that he has that kind of capital in order to purchase it outright. Additionally, it sounded like he wasnt able to get approved for a loan prior to this whole fiasco as well. In the interim while your case is being reviewed, if you two come to an agreement for him to make the payments for you that would be something you two would need to discuss as I can not advise on a personal agreement. That may be an option worth  discovering if you so wish. 



A last resort option is to sell the car outright to the dealership or attempt to sell it privately to a private buyer. If there is as remaining balance, you would still be responsible for that amount. You could work something out with Mr. XXXX regarding that amount since he was the one who put you into this in the first place. 



I again, appreciate your patience and am checking for updates daily for you regarding the case. 



Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX Executive Office Case Specialist II Executive Office Auto Wells Fargo Auto | XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX | XXXX, MN XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX To XXXX... .Thank you for your response ( this has not been sent back to XXXX ) draft only. ANY suggestions? 

I do not know financially what XXXX can or can not do with this loan. 
He needs to apply for something. He does not know which end is up or down. He will NEVER GET A LOAN at all from WF. or from any bank at this moment for that matter. If he could've gotten the loan in the first place he would have. 
He was wanting to PROVE TO YOU GUYS that he wanted the loan in the first place. 

Now am I have fought for good credit for TWO years now.. ..and I would hope as a customer of WElls Fargo that you can represent me in this. ) I ' am looking to get out of this because as XXXX admitted he wanted it in the first place then he pushed me into signing for it and yes i was excited about getting the car of course!! only because HE SAID HE WOULD GET IT WITH HIS CD right away afterwards which he did not have and LIED about!!!! 

I am NOT on the best of friendly terms with him at all but on a very angry level. YES I WAS purposely misled for not having him just buy the car himself and walk away, I made a mistake trusting him. I am only talking to him to see if he will get the loan away from me and I'm beside myself. I hear your suggestions to me and will take them as a last resort. 


Thanks SO MUCH for your help in this.

We find it very disheartening to be pre approved in XXXX and denied now after further emotional and financial investments have been made. 

XX/XX/2020 : Conditional Pre Approval from XXXX XXXX  for Conventional loan with down payment assistance program. Signed contract with XXXX and gave {$2500.00} for earnest money. Advised to pay off our car loan at closing. We continued to focus on building our savings and paying down our debt. 

XXXX - XX/XX/2020 : Weekly updates provided by XXXX for house construction and inspection processes. 

XX/XX/2020 : Correspondence with XXXX XXXX  's Credit department to confirm we were on track. Credit Repull. No feedback received about new credit scores. 

XX/XX/2020 : We emailed XXXX XXXX  for an update, no response received. 
Received an email from Benchmark to apply for loan. We reached out to XXXX and XXXX XXXX  because there was no prior information provided about this transition. They informed us we needed to proceed with Benchmark. We completed the online application and submitted all requested documents. 

XX/XX/2020 : Loan was submitted to underwriting for FHA loan with XXXX. Credit scores improved from XXXX 's to XXXX for both borrowers. We completed the request to change our student loan plan from {$76.00} IDR to {$680.00} Fixed payment plan and lost 3 years of payment history. Submitted a letter from our employer to confirm consistency in commission payments, commission was still not approved. 
Resubmitted documents for Conventional loan and 3 % Down from us, still not approved. Feedback only said we were not approved. 

Asked to bring in a cosigner. However, we are hesitant to proceed and involve another person 's credit and financial information without increased transparency in this process because our credit has been pulled a total of 4 times but only provided to us 3 times. 

This is what we request from you now : If a supervisor was not previously involved in our loan, they need to be now. 
We want a phone conference with them explaining what is going on, what can be done, or what we need to do to prepare ourselves in the future ; because we will become homeowners. 
Does commission have to be received for 12 or 24 consistent months before it can be counted as income? 
Can we be granted more time to improve our credit profile? If so, explain the numbers that we should aim for. 
If we are able to secure a cosigner what is the credit score and income amount needed for approval? 

We also hope that in the future there is increased transparency and communication between lenders and clients. As well as a better hand off process between XXXX XXXX  and Benchmark. 

We emailed this and additional information to Benchmark associate, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  associate, XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020. XXXX was the only person to reply and update us to the current status. She was informed that a branch manager called us but this never happened.

NOTE : the original has no wording for interest on unpaid debt. 3. I responded to the letter denying any debt and asked for verification I also told them to Stop all other communication other than mail. 4.

Checks for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX were deposited, but 2 checks are missing for a total of XXXX. ( probably XXXX and XXXX ) Money orders They said to talk with someone from exception processing. ( about one hour call ) XX/XX/20 Called again. Refused to give case-ID. Put on hold a number of times. Expect to have check numbers etc. Would not allow me to talk with someone in ( exception processing ) XX/XX/20 Called again. Customer service agent # XXXX ( very helpful ) Case-ID need for it to be 10 business days to fill out a form. Maybe in suspense. 

XX/XX/20 Tenant sent me copies of the checks ( tenant ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX Money Order post office XXXX XXXX Money Order post office XXXX XXXX ( missing ) been sold but not cashed Money Order Post office XXXX XXXX ( missing ) been sold but not cashed Post office XXXX Case ID # XXXX, XXXX Talked with customer service again, Case IDs created. Emailed a copy of the checks to Ally via the safe message. 

XX/XX/20 Checks from XXXX account deposited into mine. Still missing two checks. 

Talked with customer service. Wanted me to go to see if those checks were cashed at the post-office? My tenant might have to go to the post-office again. 

Case-ID XXXX Can you have the same case worker on it? 

Can I speak to your supervisor? 

Checked with the Post Office and the Money Order has been sold but not cashed. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called again, checking with back office on the deposit. Speaking with XXXX at research and development. They want me to have the checks placed on a stop payment. Then re-issue the checks. 

Now talking with a supervisor. XXXX is the name of the supervisor. 

Can not do a stop payment on a money order. 
Takes 30 to 60 days to investigate the loss XXXX processing fee for each new money order Should be a paper trail. XXXX CASE-ID They are going to investigate it and call me. Max 5-6 business days. Example : Physical deposit slip was enclosed with the 5 checks. The deposit slip listed the 5 amounts and if there were only 3 checks, something should have been noted at that moment.

XX/XX/XXXXReceived email from Deposits ECR. They basically take no responsibility for anything. Basically saying sorry, but did not answer the questions I asked. Now calling again. On hold again like all the other times. 

No resolution. Now I have to take additional steps to resolve, Ally takes no responsibility. Legal action now being considered plus reporting to XXXX  etc. 

Sending them a copy of this. 

Process is not complicated : Someone from Ally opened the envelope that was mailed with the 5 checks and deposits. ( I am sure its in their notes ) When you have a deposit slip that lists 5 checks and only 3 are there you would put that in the notes. ( nothing is listed to my knowledge because they dont share the information ) What happens now with the physical checks, envelope? Paper train.

They are detailed on one of the attachments, a listing of all of the charges I am disputing as unauthorized. The total amount disputed initially was {$1600.00} plus applicable late fees and interest charged on these unauthorized purchases. These purchases were made through the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX, a virtual currency used in the game XXXX. 
Upon noticing the unauthorized charges, I contacted XXXX to request a refund for the unauthorized charges and my request was denied. I then contacted the XXXX company and they stated that they are unable to provide refunds for anything purchased through XXXX, they can only provide refunds for purchases made directly with them. I filed some disputes on the individual transactions through the BarclayCard account website but did not receive any response for a significant amount of time. Since I wasnt receiving a timely response on this dispute, I wanted to make sure my dispute was written and delivered with the appropriate time period specified in the Fair Credit Billing Act to preserve my rights. I also cancelled that specific credit card and requested a new one given the security compromise. 
I then sent a letter, a copy of which is attached, and mailed it on XX/XX/2020 with a return receipt indicating it was received by Barclaycard Card Services on XX/XX/2020. I received no written acknowledgement of my dispute as required by the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
I then sent another letter on XX/XX/XXXX, a copy of which is attached, and it was received by BarclayCard Card Services on XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the return receipt for this letter. On XX/XX/2020 there was a refund of {$100.00} on disputed purchases that had been disputed via the credit cards website previously so now I was requesting {$1600.00} and fees minus {$100.00}. By this time I still had not received written acknowledgement of my dispute. 
Finally I sent a third letter on XX/XX/XXXX, a copy of which is attached, and it was received either on XX/XX/XXXX ( USPS tracking website ) or XX/XX/XXXX ( return receipt postmark ). By this time more than two full billing cycles had passed since my initial written dispute without resolution nor acknowledgement.

08/10/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I contacted Network funding LP XXXX XXXX. I was given the number to one of the loan officers by my realtor. The loan officer XXXX and I had a brief conversation stating the reason why I was given their number. I had previously tried getting a loan through a different lender but his lack of communication concerned me. When I called XXXX I let her know that i only had XXXX to work with. I told her I had D.A.C.A and that they had previously said my debt to income was to high. She indicated that she can work with me and we continued the process. XXXX was able to get us a pre approval for XXXX and indicated we had wiggle room to go up once we found a house. We bid on the house that week and after that everything seemed to change. XXXX stopped responding to my emails or calls promptly. She would mostly only talk to my realtor and we began having issues. XXXX changed my approval terms from a conventional loan to FHA. I was under the impression DACa a recipients did not qualify for FHA. Nonetheless we moved forward. We had a closing date if the XX/XX/XXXX. We were expecting the file to already be in underwriting I contacted them 4 days before because I had not received documents on the loan. XXXX didnt get back to me and talked to my realtor first. XXXX had not put the file into underwriting and now 4 days before was letting me know my DTI was too high and we had to change it back to conventional loan due to me having DACA something she knew before hand. She initially gave us an estimate of XXXX in closing cost. She then told me I needed to pay XXXX in debt. This quickly changed to XXXX and having to pay XXXX in debt. All days before my second push back in closing. We moved forward in everything due to it being so close to XXXX. I let her know I needed to be out of my apartment by the XXXX she said she would try and get it sent to underwriting. This was a lie my file stayed under review and eventually go into suspension due to her lack of working on the file. The listing agent and my realtor both had to contact her manager due to all the last minute changes and dragging of this company to due as they promised. Close to the second closing date she let me know we needed to find a cheaper insurance due to my DTI being high once we factored in the mortgage and monthly. We found an insurance but she did not work that into the file on time. After being left out of the equation multiple times not knowing where we were in the process I finally had my file under review. During this process XXXX took over and proceeded to tell me how we were getting my file off suspension. XXXX had said it was denied previously due to DTI being to high and said we were in underwriting to my realtor upon pressure by them to provide information. XXXX worked on my file and then came up with the fact that she had added a XXXX gift payment twice and now needed me to produce an extra XXXX to continue with the underwriting process. With me doing everything that they asked me to get my loan approved and having so many set backs due to the miscommunication, lack of working my file in time, misleading and gross mishandling of my file, this has lead me to believe they have no interest in providing the service they promised.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"NETWORK FUNDING, L.P.",TX,773XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/10/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3787931

I have called the credit card, requested an investigation, asked for the account and membership to be closed since I was not getting anywhere with Amazon. I talked to XXXX XXXX ( ID : XXXX ) who has informed me the charges would be reversed and then connected me with the Fraud department, reference XXXX. The Fraud department, instead of assisting me to address the issue at hand and close all cards opened under my name were trying to convince me to keep a service that I have no idea what it is and never have used. They asked me if I think this is identity theft. Obviously someone is using my card that I have never used and opened an account with Amazon that is not linked to my account. After one hour of back and forth they assured me the account will be closed and charges reversed. Synchrony never reversed the charges or closed this fraudulent subscription.

08/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"On XX/XX/XXXX, without prior warning or advice, CitiBank arbitrarily lowered my credit limit on my Diamond Preferred credit card ending in XXXX by {$700.00}. I was informed of this punitive action via e-mail the next day. This unwarranted credit limit reduction by CitiBank increased my balance from 89 % of my credit limit on this this card to 95 %, which left me with only {$400.00} available credit and clearly exacerbated the high credit-to-debt ratio that CitiBank claimed to be its main reason for the credit limit reduction. It has also made it nearly impossible to significantly reduce my credit-to-debt ratio in the foreseeable future. 

I also use this card for several automatic recurring payments that would have exceeded my credit limit had they been processed before I had been advised of my credit limit reduction. 

I have never missed a payment on this credit card since I opened the account in XXXX, and I pay more than the minimum every month. I have also reduced my high balance to XXXX several times. I have never heard of anyone having their credit limit reduced, let alone someone with such an exemplary payment history. 

CitiBank alleges that I am a valued customer, yet I am not sufficiently valued to be advised by CitiBank that it might have an issue with my use of credit. When I contacted CitiBank to protest, the representative with whom I spoke said it was a business decision that is final, and my record with CitiBank is irrelevant if my overall credit is not well-managedwhich, of course, is an entirely subjective, arcane, capricious, and secret, formula to which I could not possibly hope to conform if CitiBank refuses to share its concerns with me in time to take some sort of remedial action to pre-empt any such severely punitive action. Had CitiBank provided me with a guide that advises me exactly what it considers well-managed and instructions on how to correlate that with my credit report, I would have been able to avoid running afoul of the CitiBank credit monitoring. 

This unwarranted, capricious, and punitive, action by CitiBank has set off a cascade effect with my other credit card companies, acting as essentially a red flag on my credit report. As a direct result of this action and its resultant increase of my debt-to-credit ratio, XXXX XXXX XXXX reduced my limit on my XXXX XXXX Visa card by {$4500.00} two days later! Unfortunately, it is now likely that other credit card companies will follow suit and even further damage my credit score, which has been lowered by these two actions to the point that I could not lease an apartment today if I needed to do so.

08/05/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"RE : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau & State of New Jersey Department of Banking & Insurance Complaint : Mischarged PMI ; Escrow Shortage Charges ; Escrow Late Fees Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing & XXXX Dear CFPB and NJDOBI, Please accept this as explanation of our request to file formal complaints with both the CFPB and NJDOBI against the two most recent former servicers of our primary residence mortgage, XXXX and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. 

As evidenced by the attached Escrow Analysis, we continued to pay monthly PMI insurance long past the required time based on attained equity in our home. We are requesting a refund of these overpayments. 

Also evidenced by the Analysis, we were being charged late fees for escrowed tax payments we were not responsible for making. These payments were entrusted to be made by the mortgage servicers so its not appropriate that we were made responsible for paying late fees incurred due to the mortgage servicers neglect in making timely payments. We are also requesting a refund of these late fees. 

Additionally, our monthly mortgage payment had increased annually for the past several years. Upon receiving the notices, we inquired as to why and were told the increases were to cover shortages in our escrow account. Were not mortgage specialists, only homeowners, but it seems reasonable to assume that its the responsibility of the mortgage company to properly forecast annual escrow requirements prior to the end of each calendar year. Likewise, although we can accept this type of error on a single occasion, this happened for many years which is unacceptable. Due to the obvious mismanagement of our PMI and the inappropriate transfer of late fees to fall under the realm of our responsibility, it seems likely that theres also something not right with the continuous annual escrow account shortages. Wed also appreciate an investigation into this matter and possibly a refund of these additional charges. 

It is important to note that we were not receiving annual escrow analysis statements from either mortgage servicer. At the request of our refinancing specialist, we recently had to call Shellpoint in the midst of the refinance process to obtain an Escrow Analysis copy. At some point in 2017, when our mortgage was still held by XXXX, we spoke with one of their mortgage specialists regarding the escrow shortages and with a request to eliminate PMI insurance. We were told we did not qualify to eliminate PMI. Knowing what we know now, that clearly that was not accurate and the information was grossly misrepresented to us. We reached our 78 % LTV and it should have been automatically removed. 

Your investigation into these matters would be greatly appreciated.

07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2020, I went into the Citi app, selected my auto-payment, clicked on Edit/Skip Autopayment and manually entered an amount of {$2000.00} which I wanted to pay, instead of the full balance which my auto-payment normally pays. 

That evening, Citi sent two payments through to my credit union. The XXXX payment I actually made, and instead of "" change/skip '' ing my auto-payment, the auto-payment went through as usual, paying the total remaining balance ( which was now {$450.00}. 

It's important to note that the auto-payment REALIZED that I made the XXXX first, because it had updated the full amount due. Relevance for that will be clear in a moment. 

My bank processed the XXXX payment first, then returned the XXXX payment for NSF ( as expected ). When I realized what happened, I called Citi and explained the situation, explaining that THEIR SYSTEMS had caused two payments to go through when the auto-payment processed after a replacement payment had been made. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. The CSR agreed with me at least to the extent that they were sympathetic and refunded the NSF charge. After getting off the phone I logged into the app and made an additional payment of {$1500.00} to get the total payment back up to what I had originally intended to pay. 

Because the initial auto-payment was made on the due date of XXXX with a minimum payment due of {$25.00}, the payment was never late and was well over the minimum due amount. The additional {$1500.00} was made 6 days later when I realized what had happened. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Citi saying that a replacement payment needed to be made for the returned payment of {$2000.00}. At this point I'd already called Citi several times and explained what happened. I had {$0.00} due on the account, and had already made 2 "" replacement '' payments for the current billing cycle, so I ignored it and didn't make a replacement of {$2000.00} for obvious reasons. 

Only XX/XX/XXXX, Citi closed my account. I will summarize now by saying that I've used chat and phone calls to Citi to find out what's going on. It took a couple of days, but I was finally able to confirm that a letter had gone out ( on the XXXX ) but while the information wasn't available immediately, after a day or two the CSRs were able to confirm that the reason it was closed was indeed "" one or more returned payments in the past 6 months '' ( this is the only one ). I have spoken to nearing a dozen people at Citi trying to get any sort of resolution, and the best I've gotten is that a manager has "" submitted it to a department with no phone number '' for review, with the notes indicating that there was no balance, and that the returned payment was in fact replaced and that in fact the issue was a technical problem on their end in the first place. 

I've heard nothing. I finally received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX with a number to call. I have called that number several times and just receive a message that "" This department is closed, call back during normal business hours. '' I've called at XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX   and XXXX XXXX  CST and get the same message every time ( on a Wednesday ).

07/26/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We filed a complaint previously ( in XXXX ) with CFPB : the issue was that we were paying Shellpoint via ACH regularly with no problem and then all of a sudden in XXXX they stopped posting our payments. We had proof the payments were made on time every month and the ACH went from my bank to Shellpoint. After the CFPB complaint was submitted, Shellpoint all of a sudden "" found '' and properly applied the 3 months of mortgage payments they insisted were not paid but we were able to proved had arrived on time- they simply are not allocating them. 
Shellpoint sent me a letter indicating they had properly applied all payments and removed all late fees and had notified all credit bureaus to remove any strikes to my credit as a result of Shellpoint 's errors. 
We thought this was corrected and continued to pay each month, on time. Every month. 
Since that initial 'correction ' Shellpoint made they have once again reverted to not applying my payments though they are absolutely being received via ACH. 
Shellpoint collections people call me constantly insisting my account is in arrears. It is not. 
It is IMPOSSIBLE to get to anyone at Shellpoint who can fix this issue- all the collections folks say there are no payments and we're in arrears. We are NOT. 
EVERY payment has been made well before the due date. 
I really need your help in getting to a person at Shellpoint who can fix this once and for all. It is THEIR system error entirely. 
Thanks for your help!

They are saying I owe another 15 years on this mortgage which I do not believe to be true. That being said, I continued to pay it for fear of losing the house.

08/03/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"In XXXX I called Select Portfolio Services to ask about the 90 day forbearance and was told that I could have it but that I would have to pay it back in a balloon payment and I asked her, how does that help anyone. She said it's up to the lender, and if they don't get the payment, THEY would start foreclosure proceedings. So I asked, Why would you be doing anything?, your not the owner. All I got was silence, so I requested to know who the owner was and that where the run around started. They couldn't tell me on the phone, their system was down, I'd have to call back, until I got XXXX and demanded it be sent in the mail. I finally received a letter that stated it was XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee, for Park XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . Asset- Backed Pass Through Certificates, Series XXXX is the owner of the account. 

So now I call XXXX XXXX and they can find my account number but it is not me, my property or even in my state. They send me to their investigative department to open up a inquiry and give me the investigation number and tell me to retain counsel. That same day I call the local deeds office and find out that I got a Full release of Lien from the Tennessee Housing Development in XXXX and then a lien from XXXX XXXX by an attorney name XXXX XXXX XXXX sent by SPS in XXXX of the same year XXXX. 

So now I call XXXX XXXX back and they open up another investigation because they did not do it. 

So then I talk to XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told that they SOLD my loan to SPS, and I have called them twice just to be sure they said SOLD, not assigned. 

The reason I had to make sure is because I made a compliant with XXXX of Utah and they produced an assignment they got from XXXX and they said they were the servicer of the account, so I called XXXX back to make sure they meant SOLD and they said yes, and I asked for them to send everything they have in their system regarding my account, contracts, lien, release of lien, everything. 

So now I am asking myself, why if they own it, can't they just tell the truth. So I think it's because they are a collection agency and don't have the license to own mortgages, so I request information from the State of Tennessee and find out that their license has been expired since XXXX. 

My son found a case on XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee, for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Asset-Backed Pass Through Certificates, series XXXX, but what was left off my letter was BY SELECT PORTFOLIO XXXXERVICES . Which means that they are the owners, as XXXX XXXX XXXX said they were, so now why lie? 

My son found a pooling agreement written in XX/XX/XXXX on sec.gov/Archives called XXXX. Which states everyone 's responsibility to the agreement and at the end prohibits involved in the agreement from owning Trust because it is against XXXX. So then I go to the U.S.Labor Department for the law, and learn that it is a conflict of interest. They must avoid conflicts of interest, in other words, they may not engage in transactions on behalf of the plan that benefits parties related to the plan, such as other fiduciaries, service providers, or the plan sponsor. If they breach this law, the courts may take action against them that carries a 10 year term in jail and a {$500000.00} fine. 

So if XXXX XXXX says that they don't have my account, why is their a fraudulent lien on my home from XXXX XXXX XXXX sent by SPS? Right after I received a full release of deed? If the People that said they sold it to SPS, which was XXXX? Why is there a lien from XXXX XXXX, that they know nothing about? Because SPS is the owners, they just can't tell you that cause it's against the law. 

That's what I believe they are afraid of, and why they can't allow anyone to know that they own Trust. 

Then last week I receive a letter from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX in the Research and Analyst office that they found my loan in another Trust, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as Trustee of the securitization trust. It hold legal title to my XXXX mortgage. She is forwarding my concern related to the loan to the servicer of the mortgage SPS, as the appropriate party to receive and respond to this type of request. 

I call XXXX XXXX later that night, to get XXXX XXXX phone number, and get on their web page as I am waiting for an operator to answer my call, and type in her name, and when the page goes back to the home page, a username and a password comes up for me. A username that I have used before, so now I am paralyzed because I was already told by one of the investigative agent name XXXX XXXX that I have never had any loan with XXXX XXXX. Not a car loan, a credit card, nothing, so how is my information in their system. 

An agent comes on the line. XXXX, and now the account number can't be found at all. It doesn't exist. So I tell her that I am looking at my information in their system and I have never had a loan with XXXX XXXX and she is so out done, that she say 's she would be in tears at this point. 

So now I am waiting to find out what XXXX XXXX finds, and still going back and forth with SPS through the BBB of Utah. 

But one thing I know for sure, SPS is the owner, because since XXXX, they have been the only one on everything, My interest tax statement comes from them, with their name on it, XXXX XXXX has them listed, my homeowner policy has them listed as the owners? So if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, It's a duck. 

They are breaking XXXX and hiding behind other lenders as to not take responsibility for their fraud? 

The ironic thing is, XXXX XXXX is being sued right this moment for giving out 90 day forbearances to people that didn't request them, so they could get the {$500.00} to {$1000.00} from the government. So I find it funny that the people that are suppose to own mine, wouldn't give me one. Ironic?

I have 2 other people that are having the same problem, except one has a loan that was written by American Wholesale Lenders in XXXX. They were found to be fraudulent and all loans deemed null and void by the courts. They didn't have licenses or were they incorporated. They didn't even come to court. So if all those loans were voided, how has she been paying SPS since XXXX? But they all have one thing in common, they were written through XXXX, bought by XXXX, and sold to SPS. 

Thank You, and I will be filing a complaint with U.S. Department of XXXXabor as well and seeking counsel.

I called XXXX to make them aware of the issue and was told to email over the notice received from the county. After that I received no call back so I called and was informed it was "" under review ''. I kept calling once a month to check the status and was informed that it was still "" under review ''. In the meantime I received monthly notices from the county indicating added penalty and interest to the original amount of {$3000.00} to what it currently is now {$4300.00}. On XXXX XXXX I received a notice from the XXXX County representative law office XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, XXXX stating "" Notice of Delinquent Taxes ''.

I proceeded to call the number on the notice and was informed that I would need to pay the taxes by XXXX XXXX or it would proceed to litigation.

07/28/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Following a refinance of my home in XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage transitioned from XXXX to Shellpoint Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the past, I have always set-up my mortgage payments for automatic withdrawal with previous mortgage servicers ; however, Shellpoint did not offer that option in my first payment ( s ). 

I attempted to set-up automatic withdrawal in subsequent monthly mortgage payments, but their system would not allow me to do so because I did not pay my mortgage ahead of the payment due date ( they treated as if it was past due at that time ). 

Despite the fact that I elected to receive paperless e-statements, Shellpoint also does not proactively send me my e-statements via email, nor do they send me courtesy reminder emails to make my payments on-time. 

This lack of service makes it extremely tough to remember to make timely payments, particularly during the middle of a global pandemic when I have XXXX kids under the age of XXXX that are all at home because of school closures, and without reliable childcare. 

Fast forward a few months, I made my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment 2 days late beyond the grace period and they assessed a {$270.00} late fee to my account. 

At the same time of my most recent payment, I was finally able to set-up my account for automatic payments on the XXXX of each month ( not sure why it worked this time over the other attempts I have made in the past ) ; therefore, this situation will not happen again. 

I have called Shellpoint 's customer service hotline several times, and spoken with several representatives/supervisors explaining to them what I mentioned above, and they are refusing to budge on removing the late fee because they said this situation was not a systematic issue caused on their end. 

It has now become undeniably clear to me that the servicing model that Shellpoint has set-up is intentionally designed to incentivize late fees by not publishing e-statements, reminder emails, streamlined set-up of automated payments, or the sufficient customer service needed to facilitate timely payments of debt obligations. 

This lending practice is predatory, albeit extremely stealthy, but I am truly stunned that they are completely unwilling to remove the late fee especially since I have signed up for automatic payments moving forward to make 100 % certain this situation will not happen again.

07/27/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) purchased our house on XX/XX/XXXX. We have made monthly on time payments to our mortgage and escrow since then. We are first time home owners. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received an email from XXXX XXXX, a representative of our Realtor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), that the listing agent for our home had forwarded the tax bill for our property. ( She was forwarding the bill to us for record keeping purposes, however, it was not immediately clear from the email that this was the care ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX we responded to the email from the Realtor inquiring why we were forwarded the bill. We were under the impression that the first portion should have been paid by the listing agent at closing and the second half, our responsibility, should come from our escrow. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received an email from XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX  NMLS XXXX stating that we should not have to take any action on the bill since we have an escrow account and it will be taken care of by the loan servicer ( NewRez ). He advised that we "" check with your loan servicer or the town to make sure it was paid, but I would be surprised it is wasnt. '' XXXX XXXX also replied at that time to clarify that the bill had been forwarded to us only for the purposes of record keeping. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the tax bill was due to be paid. It should have been paid by NewRez from our escrow account, however it was not, and we were not made aware until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter in the mail from the town of XXXX XXXX, ME, stating the tax bill is overdue and if not paid by XX/XX/XXXX it will be Liened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX we emailed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX questioning why our bill was not paid. Same day response from XXXX XXXX advised us to contact the loan servicer ( NewRez ) to inquire why the tax bill was not paid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we submitted an online inquiry via NewRez website. We received an automated email response the same day that they had received our inquiry and would be responding as soon as possible. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter in the mail from NewRez stating they were "" working to gather the requested information and will forward it to us as soon as possible ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter in the mail : Tax Collector 's Notice, Lien Claim and Demand stating a 30 day notice of our unpaid tax bill. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called NewRez customer service and spoke with an individual ( name unknown ) asking why our escrow did not pay the tax bill and requesting it be paid. The individual was not able to tell us why it was not paid. He stated we should have paid it ourselves and that NewRez is not responsible for paying it. He actually seemed to not know what an escrow account was, stated we had a "" balance '' of ~ {$2500.00} ( which was the amount in our escrow account ) and said that if we paid the "" balance '' of {$2500.00} then we would not "" owe any more escrow ''. After a very confusing 45 minutes on the phone, we were placed on hold and the individual apparently spoke with a colleague, he returned to the line and we reached a point where we were asked to email a copy of the tax bill to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called NewRez customer service and spoke with a different individual ( name unknown ), indicating that the individual we had dealt with the prior day did not inspire confidence that the issue would be resolved. The individual we spoke with this day indicated she would escalate a request to find out why it was not paid and again asked to have the tax bill emailed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we emailed the tax bill and 30 day lien notice to XXXX. We received no response to this email. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called NewRez customer service and spoke with a different individual ( name unknown ) to inquire whether the email had been received. We were told that it "" takes 3 business days to receive the email ''. The email was sent on a Friday before memorial day weekend. Therefore 3 business days would take us out to XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called NewRez customer service and spoke with a different individual ( name unknown ) to inquire whether the email had been received. We were told the email was received and that the bill was scheduled to be paid the following Friday, which would have been XX/XX/XXXX. We were told to check the balance of the escrow account online on XX/XX/XXXX to be sure the funds had been withdrawn from the escrow account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter in the mail from NewRez stating : "" NewRez is in receipt of your correspondence regarding the above referenced loan. Due to the complex nature of the matter, NewRez respectfully requests additional time to respond fully to your inquiry '' They further stated they would : "" respond within the allotted time frame '', which was not indicated within the letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a different letter in the mail from NewRez stating we had inquired about our delinquent taxes and provided a copy of the tax bill. Further : "" Please be advised, NewRez tax department is currently investigating your delinquent tax bill. Once verification of the delinquent tax bill is completed, NewRez next step is to pay the delinquent tax bill. If any penalties are due, they will be paid by NewRez at no cost to you ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we checked the balance of the escrow account and it had not changed. There was no indication that the bill had been paid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we called NewRez customer service and spoke with XXXX XXXX, again attempting to inquire why the bill was not paid. The individual was not able to tell us why the bill was not paid, and saw no evidence that it was scheduled to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. The individual was not able to tell us when the bill would be paid. We asked to speak with a manager. 
We spoke with a manger named XXXX ( last name unknown ). She was unable to tell us why the bill was not paid in XXXX. She was not able to assure us that it would be paid in XX/XX/XXXX when it is due again. She stated the prior request for payment back on XX/XX/XXXX was sent "" without a notation '', therefore the request was discarded. She informed us that tax payments are "" batched '' therefore a onetime online payment is not possible, and was not able to tell us when the next payment batch would be sent, unable to tell us when our bill would be paid. She stated we were "" asking questions there are no answer to ''. She indicated she would send an "" escalated electronic request to the manager of the department responsible for paying the bill ''. She indicated she would hear back within 3 days. She asked that we call back in 3 days. We requested that she call us back instead and she indicated she would do so. When we asked if we could contact that department directly she indicated this was not possible because the department is not licensed to talk with customers. She stated she herself could not call the department ( instead of an electronic request ) because she did not know their telephone number or extension. She apologized several times throughout the conversation and requested that we "" trust '' NewRez would resolve the issue. We indicated that these are essentially empty and remorseless apologies and there is no way we can trust that this issue will be resolved, due to the way it has been handled thus far. We indicated we were extremely displeased with the poor customer service we have received, and lack of resolution of the issue. The phone call took 45 minutes in all. 

On XX/XX/XXXX We emailed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX with the details of this frustrating situation. XXXX XXXX responded same day and advised we contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and also file a complaint with the CFPB who is the federal regulator, and gave contact information for both. XXXX also indicated he would contact the representative at New Rez to "" get them on it also ''. 
On XX/XX/XXXX We called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX. He advised to submit a complaint and instructed on how to do so. 

On XX/XX/XXXX We received an email from Realtor XXXX XXXX indicating the listing agent from our house contacted her and was upset due to a threat from the Town of XXXX XXXX to put a lien on his client 's business ( the seller - XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ), due to the unpaid tax bill. We also received an email this day from XXXX XXXX indicating that he had a conversation with the listing agent and informed them that there was no reason for the town to put a lien on the seller as they were not the owner of record as of XX/XX/XXXX. We indicated at that time that we will be submitting a complaint to Bureau of Financial Regulation and XXXX XXXX replied "" Maybe New Rez has really dropped the ball '', to which we replied : "" I would say that is an understatement ''. We indicated we would be likely paying out of pocket at this point, since we have had no luck with trying to resolve the issue with New Rez. We asked how we could go about being reimbursed. XXXX XXXX advised we call the Town Manager, and stated the town would pay us back once New Rez finally did pay the tax. 

On XX/XX/XXXX We spoke with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX department ( XXXX ). We were told that the bill had been pain that day by the seller ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). They had gone ahead and paid the tax bill apparently wanting to avoid a lien on their business. XXXX further stated this tax bill was not our responsibility in the first place, but was actually the responsibility of XXXX   XXXX, XXXX  since they were the owners when the tax was assessed on XX/XX/XXXX. We emailed XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX as well as XXXX XXXX ( and XXXX XXXX, who has been a CC to all previous email coorespondances ) with that information. We then received a phone call from both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX Title ( this was a 3 way call ) stating that the information from the tax collector 's office that XXXX had given us was not in fact correct. The tax bill was our responsibility and we had signed documents stating this at our closing. Then became the issue : how to get NewRez to pay the tax bill from our escrow, as it should have been done more than 2 months previously, and how to pay back XXXX XXXX, XXXX for the bill they had paid that was not in fact their responsibility. 
We placed a XXXX way phone call to NewRez along with XXXX XXXX. 
The following is partial text copied and pasted from an email sent from XXXX XXXX after that phone conversation : "" XXXX and I just spoke with NewRez [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ], and unfortunately had to get tough with them and threaten legal counsel ; but by doing so we have initiated next steps that will hopefully get things on track. I'm recapping our conversation here, and also providing the instructions for next steps that XXXX and I just discussed. 
RECAP : We informed them of XXXX 's horrible experience trying to get this resolved, explained the tax bill periods for XXXX XXXX ( thank you XXXX ), and received an email from XXXX at NewRez confirming the following : 1. A  check was mailed to the tax office for XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX from NewRez to pay the tax bill, and the fees that accrued for the late payment. 
2. Confirmation that NewRez will be paying the next tax bill by XXXX. 
XXXX and I then spoke with the Tax Deputy for XXXX XXXX and confirmed that the check from XXXX XXXX, XXXX was already deposited. They are expecting the check from NewRez and confirmed once it's received, they'd simply cut a check back to them in the same amount. So here 's the next steps we've taken : NEXT STEPS : I've just sent the following email to XXXX at NewRez : "" Hi XXXX, XXXX and I just spoke with the Tax Deputy for the town of XXXX XXXX, Maine. Unfortunately, the check they received from XXXX XXXX, XXXX has been deposited. We informed the Tax Deputy that a check was on the way from NewRez, and she told us that as soon as it is received, they will simply cut a check back to NewRez in the same amount. This is their protocol that they have to follow. Therefore, we will need to follow plan B and have NewRez cut a check to the XXXX XXXX, XXXX and put in the mail by the end of the business day tomorrow. '' Between XXXX We received several emails from XXXX XXXX, manager at NewRez, with details of the process as he worked through resolving the issue with the tax department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : Ultimately, NewRez was unable to write a check to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, so they wrote checks to us for the amount of the tax bill and a separate check for the penalties/fees. We deposited both checks then wrote a check for the amount of the tax bill and mailed it to XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

I was not given a proper reason and would like to know why on the eve of XX/XX/XXXX, As the Representative and I were discussing the past Bussiness account over one and a half hours or so, I noticed the the rep had to take a call that came into her office. Since there had been such time lapse on the account, and all of the things were new including the contact number, the Wells Fargo Rep moved forward in the process of updating. So several minutes elapsed, I then notice an email from my new XXXX Account hosted by XXXX XXXX which posted at XXXX. The email stated that if I did not update the recovery phone number on the XXXX account, that there could be someone using the account other than myself. The notice came from an unrecognized device and from an unidentified location. So how did this occur? The Rep heard my inquiry with her again, as I had the impetus to ask her kindly again around XXXX if she was the person who went into my XXXX account and added the recovery number. As the rep answers no, alas on my XXXX email tied to my business account with Wells Fargo, I see an email populate at XXXX, indicating that my business account phone Pnumber had been changed. This occured after and only after I asked her if she was aware of the google recovery phone update bc I was so unclear and confused. If my accounts are closed with Wells Fargo, why am I able to see the emails and correspondence coming in to my account, and even see the correspondence coming in from the bank to me at XXXX Still would like to know how XXXX was involved and why there was an update on my phone while on the phone with Wells Fargo.

My health insurance, XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I have through my university XXXX XXXX, did not cover the claim. Later on, I called to fix the issue, as it was understood that during the Summer Break I did not need a referral by my physician to get an x-ray or receive the care. The issue was resolved, and I was under the belief that I had already paid my full amount ( ~ {$140.00} ). 

A year later, I received a bill from XXXX XXXX claiming I owed {$190.00}. Immediately, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to resolve the issue. In a three-way call with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and myself in XX/XX/XXXX, it was agreed that I only owed {$30.00} because XXXX had made an error. XXXX XXXX agreed to send me a new bill for that amount, which I have been waiting on for a few weeks. 

Unfortunately, near the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit score and noticed that it had dropped significantly as a result of a collections claim for {$120.00} from the First Federal Credit Control ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). I have repeatedly try to call him to dispute the claim, but after several calls and emails, I have never received a response. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, who initially disputed the earlier call claiming I only owed {$30.00}. However, after contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX  billing department, they had proof that XXXX agreed to cover the majority of the claim and that I only owed {$30.00}. XXXX XXXX however did tell me that I needed to contact First Federal Credit Control to pay my {$30.00}, but they have been evasive and not answering my phone calls. As a student, my credit score is a major part of my financial security in the future, and I am very upset that it is currently on my record. I would've paid the current amount of {$30.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, but because of the mistakes made by XXXX XXXX XXXX, my credit scored has severely dropped.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"First Federal Credit Control, Inc.",CA,913XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3773751

08/03/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I have had several conversations with Suntrust aka Truist about my mortgage pmt. They have a case # >Case # XXXX. I originally asked about the forbearance/deferment skip pmt programs ( because of Covid19 ) which they sent me letters about. I called approximately XX/XX/XXXX to discuss these matters and spoke to lady. ; I wanted to know if I could have one or 2 pmts deferred and put end of loan and then resume pmts after on auto pay ; They said no, it dose n't work like that?? i asked why? I spoke to someone about it approximately XX/XX/XXXX and got told i was obligated to use 90 day extension and at the end I was obligated to pay 3 months of pmts to be out of default. I said you are setting people up for failure, why make people pay right off the bat 3 pmts? i said apply extension and I pay part pmt during extension and she said they would send my part pmt back. I asked for supervisor. he gave me same run around, said I needed to speak to loss mitigation. I said I'm not delinquent nor past due. why am i considered as loss? At the time I called my loan was not past due. Nor am I past due now. I'm current. I finally spoke to a lady by the name XXXX XXXX. and she as well gave me the run around, I asked to speak to person who handles the requests. and phone # she couldnt. they expected me to submit my request online and wait for someone to call me. I asked why can't I speak to someone now. I wanted to keep my account in good standing. I sent a letter. over night signed receipt XX/XX/XXXX. the letter states specifically what I needed on per the covid19 stipulations for a deferment. Below is the letter I sent and they recieved it on XX/XX/XXXX. I have called before that and after said letter asking that XXXX XXXX return my call about the letter and have no response. 
usps tracking number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX i called the CFPB to file a complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, It seems no help there, not sure why? sun trust are purposely stalling people so they get behind and so they can foreclose their homes. They dont have any customer service skills. why? Why cant I speak to the person who will handle a deferment vs waiting for them to call me, which is after i'm late ... I'm current and not in loss mitigation nor in default so any sort of servicing should be handled differently. I want a return call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
below is the letter i sent. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Va. XXXX Ph XXXX XXXX We spoke on XX/XX/XXXX, among other things, we spoke of many concerns/issues amidst the pandemic issue and forbearance, payments to be applied etc. I need to speak to you or someone who makes decisions about keeping my mortgage in good standing. As currently my payments are current and not past due. As Im next due for XXXX. This means that Im not in default nor fall under any default remedies nor classified as loss mitigation, which I feel is terrible to be classified as such. 

Im asking to know if you can put me in contact of the person who makes and handles this request to move 2 monthly payments to the end of the loan and keep my interest rate same on my loan. Have my auto pay on hold for the two months and then have it return on to process after 2 months. Hence skip XXXX and XXXX and then resume payments in XXXX as if nothing has changed. This should keep my payment history as paid and my credit reporting as paid current is that not correct? 

I have made 2 phone calls one last week and one this week asking for a return call on this matter. I hope to have the correct person call me back to discuss how this will work before anything is done. Please advise.

I also received a notice saying if I performed a certain number of bill pay and and debit card transactions I would receive XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. 

I opened and funded the account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email confirming I had the XXXX miles promotion attached to my account and told me what debit card and bill pay activities to complete. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I received confirmation that the {$500.00} promotion was on my account and gave me instructions on seperate activities to complete to get the {$500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into the bank to ensure I had performed the correct activities and the teller confirmed my balance and said I would qualify. 

As a result I left over {$15000.00} in a new Citi checking account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told I had both promotions correctly on my account and met criteria but would need to wait for the miles and dollars to be credited. I then confirmed this again XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to follow up so many times because each time I was told I'd receive the XXXX $ bonus a different date. I finally escalated the issue and was told on XX/XX/XXXX a case would be opened, I was told that case was resolved in my favor and I would be credited {$500.00}. I kept over XXXX dollars in my account this whole time to be sure. 

Then XX/XX/XXXX - I was sent a letter with no explanation saying I would no longer receive the {$500.00} after I repeatedly left funds in the account because Citi confirmed I would receive the bonus.

07/27/20,Debt collection,Medical debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"On Friday XX/XX/2020 I received my first notice from Kebridge Medical Revenue Care regarding a debt I owed in the amount of {$40.00} dollars. This is the first notice received from this company, I immediately went to their website and paid them {$40.00} dollars to clear the debt. On Saturday XX/XX/2020 I received a notice from XXXX   XXXX XXXX that they have reported TWO debts to my credit report. One debt in the amount of {$40.00}, another in the amount of {$20.00}. I was unable to call Keybridge until Monday XX/XX/XXXX because they were closed over the weekend. 

On Monday XX/XX/2020 I called Keybridge around XXXX and told them I was calling to clear up the accounts they held in their office so that I could get them removed from the credit report. The account representative named XXXX advised me that I had a total balance of {$110.00} due in their office and this included a balance of {$28.00} dollars that my wife had owed as well. 

They suggested I was responsible for my wife 's debt and asked me to pay it, at no time did they give me any opportunity to dispute the debt, and at no time did they tell me that I was NOT responsible for my wife 's debt. I again stated that I wanted to get it cleared up immediately because I was unaware of any debt at this time. I only received one notice for {$40.00} dollars. 

Over a 3 day period, despite only receiving one notice for {$40.00} due, I paid a total of {$150.00}. After the payment was processed, I asked for this to be removed from my credit report. They refused to remove this, they stated that it would be updated to reflect the account was paid in full. I asked them to please have it removed and they refused to do so. They claim they are not permitted to remove the debt due to a federal statute but I believe this to be incorrect. I believe they are attempting to ruin my credit for a minor oversight. The representative transferred me to her supervisor ( I did not write down the name ) and the supervisor told me the same thing that I KNOW to be false. They both stated that they are not permitted to remove this from my credit report. I know this is 100 % false, they do have the power and are refusing to do so. 

They did not provide me any notice on debt owed over the initial {$40.00} payment due, they led me to believe that I was responsible for my wife 's debt owed as well. They are refusing to remove a PAID Collection account from my credit report. I believe they are engaging in unfair, deceptive, and unethical business practices and would like this company investigated and my credit cleared immediately.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,KeyBridge Medical Revenue Management,OH,430XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3765271

I am a working, highly educated lawful XXXX, on a XXXX XXXX  and I have been a client of Wells Fargo since XXXX. The fact that my application was denied due to me not being a US XXXX XXXX  holder demonstrates that I was clearly discriminated against due to my XXXX XXXX  and lawful XXXX  status.

As a woman of color, XXXX  and belonging to an XXXX minority, I could not, in good conscience, stay silent as many now in America face discrimination and unfair treatment due to being a minority. 
I have reached out to Wells Fargo via email on XX/XX/XXXX, in regards to this matter but they have not responded to my claim. 

According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act : "" The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the nations consumer protection agency, enforces the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), which prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, NATIONAL ORIGIN, sex, marital status, age, or because you get public assistance.

My husband and I are XXXX XXXX XXXX and have not been able to work full time since XX/XX/XXXX 2020. In XXXX I asked for a deferred payment and was given only 1 month. They don't offer more than 1 month. I made payments in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX and a partial payment for XXXX. Today XX/XX/XXXX, I called and asked for a payment extension for 1 month and was told that even though I'm being affected by COVID19 they can not help me because of company policies even though they claim your account need to be 20 days past due for an extension to be offered. 

It seems West Lake Financial has made up regulations to block customers from receiving help due to financial hardship. They claim you need to be 20 days past due to receive help but when you call them, they say you don't qualify because of another rule/policy. So there are company policies that override other policies in an effort not to offer assistance to customers. The aim is for customers to become so far past due that they could repossess their vehicles. 

I think this policy is wrong and they should be investigated for not treating customers fairly.

Initially the insurance company denied our claim, but after retaining a lawyer we were able to settle with the insurance in XX/XX/XXXX. The settlement check was made payable to us and our loan services, Allied Mortgage Group ( NMLS # XXXX ). When we contacted the services they said to just mail them the check, they would endorse it and return it to us. We followed these instructions but heard nothing from the services for 2 weeks. In the meantime we enter into a contact with a reputable roofing company. We finally contacted the services again, and was transfer to their loss-drafts department. The employee of this department after finding our check informed us that since it was more than {$10000.00} ( it was for {$15000.00} ) they would need to monitor the claim. The check was returned to us for endorsement together with various document to be signed by us and our roofing contractor. We completed all the paperwork and return it to the services in late XX/XX/XXXX. Again we heard nothing from the services for several weeks. We again contacted the servicer and were told that they had not received the contracts Lien Release, which we were certain they had, but nonetheless we forwarded them another copy. The servicer gave us a call to say they had all the documents they needed and to go ahead and schedule the roof replacement. We did so, and the roof was replaced in early XX/XX/XXXX. We call the servicer, or more rightly tried to call the servicer regarding next steps, and found that the number we had been using was no longer in service. We finally had to go back to the agent that originated the loan to get a good contact number for the servicer. We were then informed that their loss drafts department had moved and had a new number. ( at this point I would like to interject that what I really believed happened was that the Mortgage Loan Servicer had sub-contracted their insurance processing and they had changed sub-contractors ) We called the new number and the employee told us the could find no record of our prior paperwork, but did know the had our {$15000.00}. In the meantime our contractor need to be paid, so we paid him with funds from other sources. This was XX/XX/XXXX. Thereafter we went back and forth resending documents scheduling and rescheduling inspection for the next three months with this company before they finally sent us a check for the escrowed funds. At this point I need to note that we are snow birds the house that was damaged is in XXXX but we generally spend the summer months at our second home in XXXX. The check we received in XXXX was sent to us in XXXX and was made payable to us and the roofing contractor jointly, despite the fact we had provided proof that we had already paid the contractor. We contacted the servicer again and asked them to reissue the check to us solely. 
My complaint is that this servicer never answers the phone or return phone call or response to email or letters. It is now mid XXXX and this servicer has had our funds since XXXX the repairs were completed and paid for since XXXX. The servicer will not respond to our request to release the escrowed funds to us and there is no longer any legal reason for them to hold the funds except to used them for their own cash flow problems.

08/07/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I bought some electronics at bestbuy using my bestbuy store credit card with 18 months interest free financing. I set up recurring payments to pay the minimum with the intention of paying off the loan in a lump sum at the appropriate time. In the past when I have done this, I have been able to log into my account easily to see when the promotion was ending to make the full payment. This time, it looks like bestbuy transferred the credit card management site to Citi bank and even though they claim you can log in with your bestbuy account information, I couldn't log in when redirected to the site. I wasn't able to call in time to have this login issues resolved. And because I setup automatic recurring payments, I thought I had ample time. To my surprise, I saw an email with a balance much higher than the amount left to be paid off ( {$4300.00} instead of {$2800.00} ). Between Citi bank and/or bestbuy, it looks like they pile up all the interest accrued for the 18 months of the promotion period and apply all that at the end ( XX/XX/XXXX for me ) for you to pay, which is an unexpected and crazy amount to begin with. I have not seen any interest charge on my other credit cards applied in this deceitful way. 

Being a loyal customer for over 10 years now, I have tried working with them to get these unreasonable interests off but they have been very inflexible to work with and it really seems like they don't care, even with the hard times we are in, given the pandemic and are just happy to stick me with the interest of {$720.00} and {$920.00} for 2 consecutive months. 
I spoke with a representative about their covid relief plan, which allows an extra 2 months extension of the promotion and she said she will be able to apply that for me so I pay off the loan, which I paid off right there with my emergency stash funds. The extension was to allow me till XX/XX/XXXX and I paid the full balance off XX/XX/XXXX. However, I still see the second interest of {$720.00} after 2 days and when I called in again just today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), they are telling me they can only take off one interest charge within a calendar year so there is nothing they can do. They are now saying that i requested the assistance after they had charged the interest so it doesn't apply to me. 
I honestly do not know what to do and don't have the funds for this charge, which I strongly feel is not a fair charge to begin with. This does not seem fair at all being at the hands of such big companies charging me this crazy amount in these crazy times and basically sticking me with a severely unfair debt in my opinion. To make it even more painful, the customer service representatives only say they completely understand me but there is nothing at all they can do. I have never felt so helpless before. 
I am asking that you please step in here and help me out of this predicament.

08/01/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Two months ago I purchased some items on JC Penney website. Some items shipped while 1 did not. 

I went to the local store when they opened to return a ring that did not fit. While I was there I asked to cancel and refund the necklace I did not get yet. 

As in most cases soon as I am billed I pay my credit card off in full. So I got the refunds and cancelled the order. 

Then I went and purchase a new ring, necklace and some other gifts. 

Over a month passes and out of the blue I get an email that my order shipped. I called JCP customer services and like most large companies the services is discombobulated, and as you can guess I got nowhere. 

The item arrived last month, so I called and got a return label which was not provided with the order. Then took it to a XXXX XXXX to return. 

3 weeks pass and as I am checking my accounts on line i see a charge for that item again. I called JCP customer services, the rep could not help me so I got a mgr online. 

I told her because of everything why should I pay and then have to wait for a refund? 
Haven't i been through enough? She finally said she would issue the payment. 

I think that call caused her to say something and it caused closure of the account. 

I finally got a credit but I can not tell if there are missing amounts or not. That is a deceptive way of doing business.

I contacted my bank who verified that the money had gone out on XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX and my bank. on XXXX, I called Freedom Mortgage customer care and set up a 3-way conference with the bank, XXXX XXXX and Freedom for XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX spoke with XXXX at Freedom and gave verification that both the XXXX and XXXX payments had been sent. XXXX XXXX faxed the information to Freedom. 
My XXXX payment had been sent on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, a 3rd fax was sent to XXXX at Freedom customer care with the routing numbers for the 2 payments. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Freedom stating they would review and send a written response following the review, by XX/XX/XXXX.

I decided to use Freedom Mortgage 's on-line payment services and set up a payment for XXXX. To my dismay, it went through for a TWO month payment amount. I was able to have the bank rescind the payment. 
I did call Freedom 's help line and made the XXXX payment only on their website. Freedom still was saying that I am one payment in arrears. 
I have been sending my monthly payments with my bank checks for the last 5 months. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I again emailed a letter and support documents to Freedom. There has been no response except with their monthly payment statements showing they want 2 payments to bring me current.

08/09/20,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Seized or attempted to seize your property,"MY MOrtgage company ( XXXX XXXX ) transferred my mortage to a different lender ( LOANCARE ) XX/XX/2017 without notifying me. My last payment of XXXX was XX/XX/2017 to XXXX I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED THAT MY LOAN WAS TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT LENDER Either thru email communication, phone call, Portal communication ( which i used to pay mortgage ) or mail ( i lived out of state at time ) I found out that it was transfered to a different lender when OLD servicer provider ( XXXX ) notifies me that it's no longer servicing my mortgage. ( Caller at time had no idea where i should send my payments to ) I had no idea where to send my payments OR what was going on with my mortgage. XXXX provided me with some phone numbers and address END of XX/XX/2017. They did not have access to my new Loan # # I called this new lender and was unable to get anyone to help me. I did not have a Loan # # to reference and they did not have my Social Security in their system either. The NEW LENDER reported me to the CREDIT BUREAU 60 DAYS BEHIND XX/XX/2017 FOR THE AMOUNT OF XXXX THIS IS HOW I RECEIVED THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION. I think XXXX XXXX did not provide me with a loan ownership transfer notice when mortgage was sold. The New Owner did not notify me within 30 days of the effective date of transfer I did not have the the new owner 's name, address and telephone number ( and if different, the person who can resolve issues concerning your loan payments or any right to rescind the loan ), the date of transfer, and whether the transfer of ownership is recorded in public records. The new Lender also was to blame because when i called i couldn't get personnel to assist me and provide me with my new loan info # I called new lender and they had no records of me or my loan # # to explain if everything stayed the same during transfer??! My Loan went into default with New Lender OLD Lender and New Lender could not help provide information in a timely manner. After 6months of going back and forth i got a lawyer since they reported me to creditors and i was getting credit collection calls. I was so frustrated by this miscommunication and lack of knowledge of what was going on with my file. Lawyer adviced Died in Lieu and Short Sale as best options to just get rid of property. I didn't want to deal with stress so i said lets give the bank the property back. New lender refused Died in Lieu/ Short Sale after multiple offers, hiring a realtor, photographer, and trying to sale house for them. I feel like I was Collateral Damage during their mortgage transfer process. If i had been notified of process my loan payments wouldn't have fallen behind creating this snow ball effect. A huge snow ball affect that affected me personally for the next 7 years. Now i have a FORECLOSURE ON my credit for 7 years. I can not remove this FORECLOSURE on my credit. I need it removed. How can bank not tell me it's selling my mortgage!!?? I don't care if Bank has their property. They took it and it's over. They can keep it.. but i shouldn't have to suffer for their negligence and poor communication efforts I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING on my side even selling house myself. I have all lawyer info and communication trail with banks Please help me. I can't imagine going 7 years with this on my credit report. I understand the process of transferring servicing rights is challenging logistically ... it might involve moving thousands of loan documents .. i think this is what caused this lack of communication and transperancy but why iam I as the consumer the collateral damage? I think XXXX XXXX did not provide me with a loan ownership transfer notice when mortgage was sold.

She advised that she would complete the process after our call ended, and that someone would contact me to confirm the completion of the dispute process. She very clearly indicated that I would not need to follow-up further, but that I would be contacted. 

On XX/XX/2020, I still had received no calls regarding this matter, but upon logging in to my account observed that the charges had all been appropriately credited. However, on closer review, there were 2 larger charges, in the amounts of {$77.00}, and {$220.00}, that had somehow fallen off the claim, even though I had clearly indicated they were not recognized, and fell within the date range of the fraudulent activity. ( Please feel free to check the call transcript to verify. ) Over the last 10 days, I have been calling frequently to Customer Service to resolve this -- to have those 2 items added to the claim, and to check on their status.

08/06/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Over the last few month 's I've spend countless hours on the phone trying to resolve and correct an XXXX tax issue on my mortgage account with Lakeview Loan Servicing , LLC. 

After reviewing my account history of payments due to recent increases in my monthly escrow payment i noticed a double payment for taxes sent to the county in XXXX & XXXX for county taxes. The payment amounts for taxes deducted from my escrow account are listed below. 

XX/XX/XXXX - {$3300.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$3300.00} When I contacted Lakeview Loan Servicing about the issue via phone on XX/XX/XXXX they created a ticket to have the account looked at and told me i would receive a response in 48 hours. I never received a response from them within the 48 hours and only received an email days later stating the issue was still being evaluated. On XX/XX/XXXX i called them back again asking for an update and they instructed me they reviewed my account and stated that the payment on XX/XX/XXXX was for XXXX tax year and the XX/XX/XXXX was for XXXX tax year. This was obviously a mistake so I expressed that concern to Lakeview again and they told me I should contact the Revenue Commissioner and verify they didn't owe me a refund. I contacted the XXXX, AL County Tax Commissioners office the same day and asked for payment history for my taxes. They instructed me that they only received one payment from Lakeview XXXX in XXXX of XXXX for the amount of {$3900.00}. The Clerk confirmed that {$1000.00} of the {$3900.00} was XXXX taxes and the remaining balance was to cover XXXX taxes in the amount of {$2800.00}. After learning this I contact Lakeview and provided them with the information along with receipts of the taxes paid the revenue Commissioner provided me. After numerous more calls over the rest of the month with numerous discussion with Lakeview Leaders I received repeated conclusions from them that they had everything correct. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Lakeview again and talked to a Senior Member of Management ( XXXX - Employee number XXXX XXXX and discussed the situation with her. She again reviewed the file and told me the problem was with the County Revenue Commissioner and not them. While on the phone with XXXX from Lakieview I asked her to allow me to add the County Commissioners Office to the call and she agreed. A clerk from the County Revenue Commissioners office ( XXXX ) joined the call and the 3 of us discussed the issue. XXXX confirmed that they had only received one payment from them in the amount of {$3900.00} for the XXXX & XXXX taxes mentioned above. XXXX from Lakeview asked her if she had received 2 other checks from them and also provided the check numbers, once again XXXX confirmed that they only had one payment from them in the amount of XXXX. XXXX asked her to provide the details behind that payment and they were provided. XXXX XXXX Cashiers Check in the amount of {$3900.00} which was dated on XXXX and cashed by the county on XX/XX/XXXX. Lakeview didn't even have that payment in their system and had no idea of the transaction. At that point XXXX explained that there was obviously an issue and that she would document everything that was discussed with the myself and the County and she would once again place an escalated ticket with management at Lakeview and someone would call me in 48 hours with results. Ticket number for this was XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX i received and email from Lakeview saying the request was resolved with no explanation. When i called them back to get details and see if they corrected the issue I received the same story that I had previously received from them over the month that the taxes payments were from XXXX & XXXX for {$3300.00} each year. Once again i explained the whole situation with another leader ( XXXX ) at Lakeview for over an hours on XX/XX/XXXX. After review of the account he agreed with me there was definitely and issue with the account and that he would create another escalation in the system for review and explain the situation in more details and re-word what XXXX had previously submitted. Today XXXX, I again called them and was informed that a note on my account stated the reason behind the double tax payment was due to the fact that we had to pay taxes twice a year. I explained to the customer service rep that wasn't true and asked to talk to a leader again. The leader Mrs. XXXX explained to me that the issue was still under review with no estimate on when it would be reviewed. 

This has negatively effected my Credit Score due to having a negative escrow balance which was increased the loan balance and was picked up by the Credit Bureau. In addition they have increased my monthly payment for escrow by nearly {$140.00} for the last 6 months and today XXXX, I received an update from them that they would be raising my payment again in XXXX by another {$330.00}. 

In conclusion, this whole issue could have been resolved if Lakeveiw paid the XXXX taxes that were still due after the closing. They were notified in Late XXXX by me that i received a notice from the Tax Commissioner that we still owed {$400.00} for unpaid taxes on the property when we closed on the house for XXXX. Lakieview received the letter from me that same day via email that the county sent. They instructed me they would handle the issue and I had no further actions. In Late XXXX I was notified from my closing attorney that the taxes fro XXXX had never been paid and that the house was auctioned off for tax sale. I contacted Lakeview on this issue immediately following the call and they said they would handle the taxes and redeem the property and any late fees or penalties would be covered by them. I instructed them this had to be handled quickly because I wasn't able to file for Homestead Exemption. Taxes were never paid until XXXX for the XXXX & XXXX Tax Years.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",AL,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3781273

07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Oh boy, where to start. 

Initially, my husband and I realized credit fraud had happened when I tried to co-sign on a loan application with my son. I was turned down based on my credit report that showed a credit card had been opened in my name with US Bank, I believe in XXXX, 2019, with a charge and balance of {$13000.00}. ( I am not certain if this was a single charge or multiple charges ). The card appears to have been issued by XXXX XXXX, but again, I am not certain how XXXX fits into this complaint. 

Unfortunately, I do not have exact dates or the number of times I attempted to call the different agencies or businesses involved, but to give you an idea of the madness, I have literally written down 15 different phone numbers to the four primary players ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and US Bank ) I was given to try and resolve this issue. Online websites to these four provided even more numbers. At one point I was told by US Bank to call the collection agency because the matter had been turned over to them adding a fifth company. The collection agency was much more helpful and cooperative than US Bank has ever been but was essentially told that I needed to resolve this with US Bank. 

But US Bank does not seem to care. When you think about it, I am not only trying to restore my credit but help the bank recover $ 13k dollars and at least try and prosecute the perpetrator so he/she will not continue their evil ways. 

Part of my problem in getting this resolved is that I work full-time and do not have the time at work to resolve the issue especially in dealing with this extremely time-consuming bureaucratic nightmare. Also, it has been impossible for me to fully understand the issues and resolve this fraudulent matter myself, so I enlisted my husbands help who in turn has spent countless hours trying to figure out the details. Something so simple has morphed into an endless cycle with "" Customer Service '' representatives who have forgotten why they were hired. 

To resolve the problem, US Bank told us they were available 24-7 so we should contact them during hours when I am not at work. So we called during non-business hours, reported the problem and asked US Bank to please allow my husband to be added and authorized to represent myself because I not only trusted him in such matters but knew that I did not have the time or patience to resolve this on my own especially given the absurd run-around primarily by US Bank. It is worth noting that on one of many conversations with US Bank, we were told that they would be sending out some sort of paper work to further identify the charges and I supposed to be a form we could fill out to file an official complaint and inquiry and add my husband as an authorized agent on my behalf. Never received anything. 

More than two weeks later, my husband called US Bank again. The Customer Service agent told my husband they would have to speak to my wife since the account was in her name. After explaining that we had already tried that and were led to believe US Bank had already added my husband as an authorized person when I spoke to them several days prior, my husband continued the dialogue initially in a pleasant but firm manner. The Customer Service agent eventually hung up on my husband. On the 2nd call he was not as courteous and admittedly berated the agent ( after initially trying to cordially explain our problem ) and was hung up on by the Customer Service agent a 2nd time. ( Keep in mind, this is after numerous calls and exchanges with US Bank Customer Service Representatives. 

Our problem ( both myself and my husband ) is that this account and fraudulent charge had nothing to do with either of us. IT WAS FRAUD and yet we feel we have been treated by US Bank as the criminal, unwilling to offer reasonable help and direction. US Bank and their Customer Service agents have been rude and frankly incompetent to listen and think outside the box of their standard legalistic rules. My husband in trying to resolve this was not requesting any personal information about me, the credit card number or any other information that could have been used against me even if we were not married. He was not asking for anything that could make the situation worse, but desperately tried to make US Bank understand that our attempt to clear up the matter was in ours and US Banks best interest. 

We simply needed HELP from CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES to correct a wrong. But because US Bank does not have representatives who have the ability to consider the entirety of each situation on its own merit and could not think out of the box beyond their own inept and limited rules, we continue to struggle to have someone from US Bank act as if they care about FRAUD or anyone else other than the criminals rather than innocent potential customers. We requested many times to escalate this to someone else willing to listen, but their way of handling Customer Service was to hang up. 

I would like to know how someone can apply for and be issued a credit card so easily. Are there not checks and balances to thoroughly vet and investigate your applicants without a picture or something else proving they are who they say they are? No wonder there is so much FRAUD in the industry. 

The bottom line is again I need assistance from US Bank to resolve this matter and recommend changes to your policies and perhaps additional training to your "" Customer Support '' agents in dealing with FRAUD. A little bit of effort from your investigative FRAUD department may boost your profits by {$13000.00} with maybe 2-3 hours of investigation. Pretty good return I'd say. 

Please make immediate arrangements to add my husband, XXXX XXXX as my authorized agent in resolving this matter and taking whatever action is necessary to dismiss this charge from your records within 30 days from the date of this notice or I will have no choice but to retain legal counsel and pursue all remedies and recourse as allowed by the governing states and agencies of both Texas and Minnesota.

08/13/20,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem extending the lease,"I had a four year lease with Fusion Auto Finance that was completed on XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/2020 I contacted Fusion and asked if they offer any extensions. I was told yes. The maximum extension without a re-lease is a month to month payment not to exceed six months. If I were to extend pass the six month period, I'd automatically have to lease for one year and/or buy the vehicle. I was told in order to do so, I have to call before the lease termination date and agree to my option of choice in which I did on XX/XX/2020. I was again told the same information as to how each option functioned and differed. I agreed to the "" month to month '' option, told the necessary paperwork will be processed and to call back on the following Monday- XX/XX/2020 to make a payment over the phone in which was done. I confirmed that I will be doing the same next month. I called to pay today, XX/XX/2020 and was told that I have to "" return the vehicle in two weeks, by the end of the month '' and that they are "" no longer doing extensions which is determined case by case. '' I was only asked of how many miles are on my vehicle and told I can not extend, I have three weekends to purchase another vehicle. I asked how could this be as I was told and confirmed with multiple times that I have an extension of up to six months directly with Fusion without a contractual one year lease? The response was that it's not contractual on their end to give me an extension, it's direct orders from the CEO 's and they just have to enforce it, I don't qualify for the extension, the rate will be to high if I re-lease, it was a kind gesture on their part to do because of Covid-19 and I have a curteous grace period of two weeks to purchase a new vehicle, the dealerships are open. I claimed this was irrational, unfair, poor customer service and a hardship on my end as well as their customers especially with the short notice. I spoke to this same individual ( who has been helping me throughout, since last year ), and told him you were clear with me as to how this worked and nothing had to do with Covid. I  called him back about a hour later and asked to speak with a manager to escalate a complaint. A friend of mine whom is knowledgeable and well versed in finance/contracts was on this call, I stated so, and gave permission for him to ask questions pertaining to the issue and my account. The tone then changed, the individual was short, quick to do away with, then says his manager will tell us the same thing he did and won't talk with him because he is not on the contract. We were then transferred to the manager and he offered only one month to keep the vehicle, I would have to pay for that month and then return. No more or less- he "" can't do anything for me and it's not contractual to do anything, nor deliver on what was said to me. The company is losing a lot of money and needs the vehicles back. It was a gesture for the pandemic at hand extended to their customers. '' Although, that was never stated in prior conversations or told that it's a possibility to retract, nor was I under the impression that my verbal acceptance of the month to month extension wasn't contractual.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Fusion Auto Finance,NY,11755,None,Consent provided,Web,08/13/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3795009

08/06/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I am writing you for a second time, I have recently had an occurrence with Wells Fargo of which I was stated and forced to comply with a Rule regarding Debit Card Transactions of which I was never Disclosed of. As stated to me bye a Banker in the Executive Office on XX/XX/XXXX, this is a "" Back Office Rule ''. Why was I forced to comply with a Rule that was not Disclosed to me? I don't think this is Legal. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to purchase a Portable Air Conditioner from a company called "" XXXX '' The particular model I was purchasing was much more costly with the Major Merchants, XXXX, and others, In an attempt to save money, in good faith I attempted to purchase this product from "" XXXX. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I saw the charge come through under name "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I was unfamiliar with the this name and the charge was not for the initial {$99.00} which was the advertised cost of the product, the charge was for {$110.00}. Now, while the amount was different, my greater concern was the name of the company that charged my Debit Card. Further I was a bit concerned that it was a product of XXXX, as COVID is now present. When I saw the second name, I immediately googled it and as a surfed the internet for this company I came across a Web Review site. This site had a consumer statement on it which stated the company was Fraudulent. While I realize the product I purchased was at a price much lower than that of other Merchants, my greater concern was that of the statement bye the Consumer. The consumer stated that they were unable to purchase over {$100.00} worth of products from the site and found that very unusual and stated that it was fraudulent. This also appears to be as a matter of investigation bye "" de-reviews '', the company where the statement appeared. The site further stated that the prices were far to Unrealistic to be believable and the cap of {$100.00} or purchases was also not reasonable. I believe I may have just been a victim of some who was just trying to get a good deal. The link to the site that reported XXXX as fraudulent was XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please read the Site 's statements regarding the observation and review of XXXX aka "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. Moving on, upon my initial filing of the claim, I was informed it would take 10 days for the Matter to be investigated and if found my favor, a credit back to my account. While I was content with that answere and followed up a couple of days later. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up on the claim claim I was assisted by a representative, who later transfered me to a women in the Claims department bye the name of XXXX. Now here is where al of the confusion started. XXXX stated to me that my claim would take 15 Days to process and determine if I should get my Funds returned to me. I stated to XXXX that I was aware of the Policy, and it's 10 Business Days, not 15. XXXX argued with me with vigor about the Policy being 15 and not 10 and I stated to her I didn't have that on any Disclosures for my account. XXXX stated it was not Well 's policy, it was a XXXX Policy. I then stated I would contact XXXX and verify this, XXXX provided XXXX XXXX  phone number. I called XXXX and spoke to a representative named XXXX employee ID # XXXX. XXXX stated that XXXX does not make policy as it pertains to the handling of Merchant Transactions on a Customer 's Debit Card, when it is a Bank Issued Debit Card, Wells in this case, makes the policy. So obviously, information provided to me bye XXXX, was incorrect XXXX stated that she would provided further assistance and connect me to XXXX, XXXX is the Wells Fargo representative for XXXX. XXXX, Wells Fargo Employee # XXXX, stated I was correct regarding the policy and it's 10 Day limit for investigation and reclaiming funds to the account. She further stated that based on my explanation and the evidence I uncovered about XXXX XXXX, the claim appeared to have been filed incorrectly. XXXX was clear and concise to commend her on her way of her handling of the call. She further Stated to me that the Claim stated the claim I filed stated "" I was unhappy with Merchandise ''. I made it clear to XXXX, that was not the claim I filed, I filed a Fraud Claim, it appears however the Initial Representative Filed it wrong. In attempt to make a very long and arduous process of attempting to get my claim filed shorter, I was told many times that the Policy was 15 Days for, when Wells 's Policy is actually 10 days in regards to these types of claims. Every employee with the exception of XXXX and XXXX, in the Executive Office agreed with me. Turns out, Wells Fargo, has a "" Back Office Policy ''. A stated to me by XXXX in the Executive Office on XXXX, was the reason, I would not find the Policy written anywhere was because it was a "" Back Office Policy ''. I firmly explained to XXXX that such a "" Back Office Policy '' as she called it, was unlawful. I further explained, that the terms of how such transactions are handled as there is a XXXX Debit card issued to almost every account holder, must be in expressed written terms to comply with Disclosure Rules. What must be Disclosed to the account Holder is the processing Times of such a Transactions. I further advised there are no such things called "" Back Office Policy ''. I firmly stated, if it is not Disclosed to a customer, it's unlawful. Apparently Wells Fargo as an organization is in the business of creating "" BACK OFFICE POLICIES '' to undermine the rights of the account Holder. This is clearly a Unfair Practice and should not be. It took me several hours of calls and I spoke to many people just to get a lousy Provisional Credit on XXXX. While I have all of the information that may have prompted any consumer to take the same action, as it is believed that this was a fradulent merchant, never did Wells request to see it or care. Yet they tried to enforce some "" Back Office Policy '' on me, that I've never heard of. THIS IS UNFAIR PRACTICE AND MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER ARE BEING LIED TO. DISCLOSURE IS a NECESSARY AND LAWFUL PROCESS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE BANK AND THE CONSUMER. THEREFORE, WHY IS WELLS FARGO NOT BEING COMPLIANT IN DISCLOSING THIS RULE TO AN ACCOUNT HOLDERS? HOW MANY OTHER "" BACK OFFICE POLICIES "" EXIST? THIS IS NOT COMPLIANT OR LAWFUL.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NJ,070XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3783433

To be clear at no point in time was there mention of the promotion being deferred or the interest having to be charged back to the principal at the end of the promotional period. However, that is exactly what best buy Citi card resorted to. Upon termination of the promotional period, interest was charged back to the account, which lead to an increase in balance of over {$460.00}. Subsequently, the balance was reported to all major credit reporting agencies, and the added interest began to accumulate interest of their own. Needless to say, The increase in balance also leads to an increase in minimum payment and of course higher interest accrued monthly.

Of course we couldn't, so we were not approved. We were then denied the return of our earnest money because the lender was then unwilling to provide a document saying we were not approved. The lending officer lied on multiple occasions to us regarding the approval and process and details of the loan. He failed to clearly and accurately disclose the terms and conditions. Over the phone, he articulated his opinion that this was not a good deal to take, and after the realization we were not qualified for the loan based on the inability to meet their approval requirements, we did not get the loan or the home. The lending officer then promised he'd send a letter over stating we couldn't meet the terms and were not approved based on those terms, and then promptly did nothing of the sort.

Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above-named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time, I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX  or XXXX  } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices can provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when in fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS. 

It would be advisable that you assure your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action against your company and your client. This is an attempt to correct your records, any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

I had a lot of financial hardships at that time that prevented me to pay on time and I did not have an address to provide for any mail that needed to be forwarded. 

I received a call from a representative at I.Q Data international who was very hostile and used threatening language towards me stating, that they will come after me. They continually harassed me for months at a time. 

They currently have a collection on my account that goes up every month due to interest but the balance is incorrect, which I tried disputing in I believe XXXX of 2018 through XXXX XXXX but it did not help. 

I went on to I.Q Data international website to see if I could find the amount due on the account and it shows incorrect. The balance reads the following : Original Principal Balance {$7400.00} Current Interest Balance {$2200.00} Current Balance {$13000.00} Current balance on my credit report States {$13000.00} When I add my Principal balance and Interest balance it comes out to : {$9700.00}.

On XX/XX/2020, XXXX  credits the full amount {$66.00}, however I went to the Citibank site as I usually do when I pay my bills due for the first week of XXXX. When I tried to make a payment the site showed : {$0.00} balance no payment due at this time. 
On XX/XX/2020 the new statement came out with a {$29.00} fee for late payment. I chatted online with and called Citibank on XX/XX/2020 to ask for a credit for that late payment fee since when I tried to pay the credit card the site will show a {$0.00} balance. The rep via chat could not help me and I got disconnected from the chat and was unable to get back to it. The Citibank system did not let me back into the chat, I got a message that session was over, turned off the computer and tried again, same message. Then I called to close my account and the Citibank rep said the only help he could provide was a 2 % credit to my future purchases to not exceed {$100.00} for total credit. He stated he could not waive the {$29.00} fee because even though XXXX  credited the full amount of the statement balance, I still needed to make a {$35.00} minimum payment. Minimum payment for what?

I corresponded with the credit card company via their app. The corresponding customer service agent responded that the fee that was charged was in the cardholder agreement. When I responded that the cash advance fee increase associated with the credit card had never been communicated, he referred me back to the cardholder agreement on their website. This is a XXXX XXXX card that was automatically issued when Costco converted from honoring the XXXX XXXX card that we had originally. 
When I explained that I had never seen this fee, I was referred back to the cardholder agreement on their website. I think that the previous original cash advance fee percentage was 3 % and not the 5 % that I was charged this time. There is no way for me to confirm or were they able to verify when the increase was made. I am willing to pay for the lower percentage but feel that being charged for the higher percentage that is arbitrarily set by the card company without proper notification is unacceptable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",GA,300XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3783354

I recently got an alert from XXXX  that I got a report filed against me ( for not paying the membership fee ). My credit score has been reduced by 50 points. I have few issues with that : ( 1 ) I never received a bill for the membership fee. I dont understand, how I can be held accountable for a payment on a bill I never received ( especially during a covid pandemic ). The customer rep admitted ( on the phone ) that the bill may have been lost in the mail due to covid.

( 2 ) No one from Barclays reached out to me to notify me that I had a payment due. Instead of notifying me, they went behind my back and bypassed the process to maliciously report me to XXXX.

( 3 ) They have my banking information on file ( as the customer rep said on the phone ). Why did they not debit the baking account? What is the purpose of having that information on file, if they arent going to ever use it.

( 4 ) I have never used the card ( literally never ). 

( 5 ) I alerted them that I will be reporting them to the FTC and they seems to not care.

This is concerning a monthly bill I never received ( it should be a XX/XX/2020 bill that was due in XX/XX/2020 ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,VA,221XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3782255

07/27/20,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I recently applied for a loan and found a collection for Waypoint Resource XXXX ( behalf of XXXX ) and called to discuss. I've moved several times ( 5 ) in the past two years and had no idea this issue was out there. I called Waypoint Resource XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ approximatey XXXX XXXX EDT left a message and received a call back. I attempted to settle for delete which was denied so I called the original creditor. Was transferred to the billing office ( not the collection office and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX   EDT. She was more than happy to collect my funds, never advised me it should be transferred to collections, said it would be deleted from my credit report multiple times and would happen automatically. She said I would receive an email receipt of the payment and could log into my account to confirm the payment as well. I submitted the payment and waited. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a text confirmation of processed payment. I did not receive an email and my account did not show me the payment receipt. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke with XXXX ( sp? ) who confirmed it should be deleted automatically from credit bureau in 30 days but would not provide me documentation. I asked for a receipt of payment. He said he couldn't get me one. Had to escalate to manager ( did not get name ) who also confirmed to the rep that it would be deleted and they could request a hard copy be mailed to my address within 3-5 days but were not able to send electronically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX edt I called and spoke with XXXX at Waypoint Resource. He confirmed they received automatic notification from XXXX that it was paid in full. He also claimed they would send a second notification to Waypoint Resource to have it deleted from the bureaus. 

On XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX EDT I called and spoke with XXXX at XXXX. She also confirmed they would send an electronic request to Waypoint Resource to have it deleted from my credit report.

It's important to note that 3 different representatives at XXXX and 1 rep at Waypoint Resource ALL confirmed it would be automatically deleted via an electronic notification from XXXX to Waypoint Resource. According to one of the XXXX representatives, his manager ALSO confirmed this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX  EDT called and was transferred to a disconnected line. 
Called back @ XXXX and spoke with XXXX ( sp? ). XXXX said she wasn't sure but spoke with her manager who said it would be deleted after 30 days automatically. 

Escalated this call to the collections department XXXX why wasn't it there all along? This was a charge off, completely improper to be handling this as billing ) Spoke with XXXX. XXXX was sympathetic and transferred me to her Supervisor, XXXX XXXX. XXXX said there was nothing he could do. The company would not stand by any of their employees. The company would not honor the statements of 3+ representatives. Told me everything about how the account was handled was wrong and it should have gone to Collections. Confirmed it WAS a charge off ( why are they even collecting on it then, is that legal? ) Had the wrong phone number and the wrong address, still! I asked for notification that the account was paid and a pay to delete in writing. He said he couldn't provide either. He said it was my debt and I could have confirmedverified it before but could not dispute it as it was factual. They had ALL the wrong info. Felt a bit intimidated that he told me I couldn't dispute. He advised I would receive a call from his manager, XXXX he gave me his direct contact # in the event of any questions. While I can appreciate the gesture, this also circumvents any official recording, monitoring of the calls and feels like this is a questionable business practice. Doesn't XXXX provide him with a number that I should be calling? 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX EDT. Still no call from XXXX. No letter of receipt from XXXX. The account had no notations from the manager. He advised he would reach out to her again and ask her to call. Then offered to email me a paid in full receipt?!!! They said they couldn't do that? I consented to the receipt. The receipt WASN'T in XXXX XXXX  name. So who did I pay? Apparently, Waypoint Resource Group. I  never authorized a payment to a collection agency but somehow they took payment? My payment from my credit card is to XXXX. This seems like a completely fraudulent scheme. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX am. Still have not received any further communication, written or verbal, from the company regarding my issue. 

I feel completely misled and the subject of questionable, if not completely deceptive, business practices. My consumer rights were violated multiple times as a result of my interactions with this company. 
If an account is in collection, it should be handled by the collection department or authorized, trained personnel. My claim was handled be several non-collection representatives who misrepresented themselves and my situation and caused additional financial hardship. 
If a customer makes a payment, then a receipt should be immediately available. It's been 20 days and I still have nothing from XXXX showing I made a payment to them. XXXX prevented me from following my consumer rights by intentionally withholding receipt of payment. 
Customer 's should NOT be told they can't dispute information on file like XXXX told me. He said it was "" factual '' and so could not be disputed. And yet, he had both an incorrect address and incorrect phone number associated with the account. 

I admit, I should have required verification of the debt prior to any payment. But I was attempting to secure a mortgage and assumed ( ignorantly, it seems ) I was dealing with a respectful organization that would appreciate the settlement of the debt. It as for a small amount ( {$350.00} ) and would not have expected the difficulties and unfair business practices that I've been subjected to. 

I expect XXXX to stand by the commitments of it's Employees and show value to its customers. I urge them to do the right thing in the resolution of this issue.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Waypoint Resource Group, LLC",NH,None,None,Consent provided,Web,07/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3765835

I was out of the State for a few days because of a family emergency so I am just receiving the notice. I was never contacted by phone by a constable. I left to go out of town on XX/XX/XXXX that afternoon and it shows on the document that it was left on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I was never served by the constables or by certified mail. I live in an apartment complex which anyone has been able to walk by and see the documents with personal information on it. We are in a pandemic right now which funds are very low because I am a single mom. I am being sued by XXXX XXXX which Walmart is the original creditor. The amount I am being sued for is in the amount of XXXX. A few weeks ago a lady came to my door and wanted me to open but refused to identify herself. I live alone with my son and I am taking every steps to avoid being around anyone who is sick with COVID-19. The lady kept telling me I needed to open the door so she could  hand me a document but I told her that I needed to know what this is about and there is no way I'm opening my door for a random person. I asked if she could leave the document and she refused. So again instead of me being properly notified meaning by certified mail or by a constable the court document was taped on my door with personal information and for the apartment complex to see. 

On the court document it says that the petition was filed on XX/XX/2020 but papers was left on my door on XX/XX/2020.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,TX,765XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3786966

07/29/20,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Hello. I am continually being harassed by Receivable Performance Management about a debt that has false charges on the account.  On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative and was told that they would put in a dispute for the amount of the false charge, they did not, instead they put in a dispute for something that i said nothing about and refused to review the recording so that they could hear that was not what I said. Also in the same conversation I was told that I could do a payment plan for a the amount of {$5.00} per month, when I received another call from them and told them I want to proceed with that plan once the false charge is settled, I was then told that I can't do a payment plan for that amount when I was clearly told I could. Also any time I ask to speak with a manager either they lie and send me to another rep, or when I insist on speaking with one they hang up in my face ( that conversation is recorded also XX/XX/XXXX ). I also attempted to get the recording of my conversations, I was told that I was being transferred and was hung up on twice. The manager that did this is XXXX XXXX. This company is very aggressive, deceitful and very disrespectful. This type of treatment is unacceptable.

08/07/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"In XX/XX/2020 I reached out to M & T Bank regarding any help or payment options they could offer due to the fact my income was significantly impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an email I submitted from M & Ts message center on their online site, on XX/XX/2020, I made it very clear that I did not want any product or offering that would be associated with a forbearance. A representative then called me and explaining that I was being offered a 6 month deferred payment option. It was made very clear that I would not have to make a payment until XX/XX/2020, and that the payments I didnt make for XXXX through XXXX would be deferred to the end of my loan with no fees, penalties, or negative impact to my credit. When they assured me over the phone that this was not a forbearance and even went as far to explain that there were mtg companies out there that were offering relief but only to put customers into a balloon forbearance where all payments would have to be repaid immediately following the waiver period, they assured me M & T did not operate like that with their customers. I felt comfortable enough at that time to initiate the deferred payments. Further more, I received an email reply thru M & Ts messaging feature on their website following up on my email I had originally submitted. I replied back indicating that I had spoken to someone and that I was assured I would not be entering into a forbearance. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/2020, I am receiving calls from M & T, which I missed. Voicemail last are left so when I return the call I am led through a recording indicating my call is an attempt to collect a debt anything I say or provide can be used to collect a debt. When the representative finally comes on the other line, after verifying all of my personal information, he asks me if I am still being impacted from COVID 19. And he continues to ask me in a way as if he is trying to lead me down a road to say yes so that I will continue to not have to make payments or give him the answer he needs to hear to grant an extension of deferred payments. He indicates that Im still in forbearance and that I may qualify for an additional 6 months of payment relief if I am still impacted. I am appalled by the fact that they were trying to encourage me to answer a certain way so they could continue string me along hoping to either gain additional late fees or impose penalties if I slipped up and was not able to make payments on time. I also immediately asked if my account reflected a forbearance and after the rep answered yes I immediately informed him that I was told I was granted a deferred payment plan. He insisted that was not the case. I finally was able to have him verify with a supervisor the facts of my account and after waiting on hold he did come back on the line and assure me that yes, I was in a deferment. I informed him that my intentions were to resume payments that were due XX/XX/2020 as I was instructed to do so from the beginning. However that comment was met with a reaction by the rep that I would need to call back in prior to making the payment to make sure I was no longer impacted by the economic loss of COVID-19 and that I could still request an additional 6 months of no payments. Again I assured the rep that I would be making that payment. It was as if he knew that nothing changed on my account and M & T was still showing my account as part of a forbearance. 

I have now received a second phone call on XX/XX/2020 similar to the call I received in XXXX. Again asking me all of the same questions to almost guide me into asking for more time before repayments began. This time though I was more aware and not caught off guard by their questioning. And I demanded to know if my account showed that I was in a forbearance. The rep indicated that it was. After re-explaining everything again to her up to that phone call, she put me on hold a couple times to get more support from her supervisor. She came back on the line to confirm she saw all of my emails and notes from prior phone calls that show I explicitly asked not to be apart of a forbearance plan. I told her I felt deceived, manipulated, lied to, and misled. I think she felt genuinely upset because of the situation M & T put me in. She became very soft spoken and apologetic and insisted on transferring me to her supervisor where she asked me to re-explain my situation with the same emotion. She apologized profusely and acknowledged again the many times I asked not to be placed in a forbearance and was assured it was a deferred plan. 

Speaking to the supervisor was a complete waste of time. She continued to pressure me into believing that I would be considered to have deferred payments at the end of my forbearance but that my account would always show I was in a forbearance period/program. She continued to threaten me with statements that if I asked to be removed from the forbearance that all late charges payments and interest would immediately be applied to my account for the payments not made since XX/XX/2020. I reiterated over and over that I was assured I was in a deferred plan from the beginning. She tried to say I was notified in XX/XX/2020 XXXX even though that phone call end with assurance I was not in a forbearance plan ). It was as if nothing I said was going to change my account. After going back and forth for a long period of time and asking to speak to her supervisor, she finally indicated her supervisor, XXXX, was in a meeting and didnt know when she would be able to speak to me. The rep said that XXXX would have to call me because she had no direct line or email that I could speak to her through. As of the time of this complaint XX/XX/2020, I have still not received a call back. I feel completely deceived, I feel they manipulated me, told me one thing but set me up for something completely different and unwanted. I feel they are using predatory practices to take advantage of customers and I feel this will have a negative impact on me and my financial situation for a long time. They are taking advantage of me and who knows how many others at a time that we are all vulnerable and trying to figure and deal with extreme uncertainty. I sincerely hope you use all of your authority to do what you were enacted to do and protect consumers like myself and many others who may not even be aware of what is being done.

07/30/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I am a military vet. I've owned my home for 5 years and use Freedom Mortgage. I recently decided to refinance, lowering my intrest and term length. Freedom Mortgage contacted me to start this process. 

The initial processing went relatively smooth. People and loan officers contacted me and set everything up. 

I was told a mobile notary would need to come to my home to finalize the loan documents. We set up a date and time for that to happen. We selected the first date available and it was a 3 week wait. 

3 weeks later, on the date and set, noone shows up. We called the mobile notary company and they said they are waiting paperwork from Freedom Mortgage. 

Here is where my problem started. I've called Freedom Mortgage countless times. I've explained my issues to multiple people and multiple supervisors. Noone is helping me or contactimg me back. 

Everytime I talk to the refinance department they tell me a Supervisor will call me back. They do not and have yet to call me back. Everytime I ask to talk to a Supervisor, I am sent back into the regular queue and have to start the process over. 

The actions and treatment of Freedom Mortgage 's customer service and refinance department is unethecial at best. The employees lack of knowledge and inability to take action when helping a customer is astounding. Everytime I talk to them I wait on hold for at least 60+ min and make no progress no matter who I speak to. 

They should be ashamed and embarrassed of their customer service.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,OH,450XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/14/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3770958

08/10/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposited check into my checking account for the amount of {$14000.00}. This deposit was made by a known friend of mine and cleared the bank. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account showed the new deposit was available. 
Beginning XX/XX/XXXX, I began using a portion of the deposited funds to make purchases and payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that my debit card for the account was no longer working. I tried to access my account online and was not able to log in. I first got in touch with a customer service representative at SunTrust Bank "" Now Truist '' on XX/XX/XXXX. They informed me that all 3 of my personal checking accounts were frozen and being investigated by their prevention & loss fraud team. 
As of that date, I was told that they would be looking into the matter for 5 business days and would determine after this point if they were closing the accounts. They informed me that the investigation could last 5 business days, the closing of the accounts would be 10 business days and that I would ultimately receive my funds, if they owed me any, at 7 to 10 business days after the first two processes were complete. 

It has been 17 days since this began and I have still not been given a specific reason as to why this is happening. I have spoken with countless customer service representatives at SunTrust Bank and they all tell me that it is being investigated by their internal fraud department. I have also spoken with the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX, at the XXXX, GA location. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX GA XXXX ) She has attempted to escalate this up with no solution. 

I have been a customer of Suntrust myself for almost 10 years and one of the accounts has been in our family since XXXX. I understand that they say this is their policy and can freeze accounts without warning, but I have yet to see any letter informing me of this. I have been given no answers specifically to what caused the freeze. I can only assume it is the check that was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. I have also had the endorser of the check and their bank confirm that it cleared. 

I have searched online and this seems to be common practice from SunTrust Bank and it is an unfair practice to not give any information to the customer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/10/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3787802

I was told they corrected that error over the phone and to watch my account to make sure it posted correctly. My Payoff amount that I received was good through XX/XX/20. I noticed that both accounts posted and then shortly after I noticed that the {$99000.00} did not post. At this point I am concerned that my money will not be applied to my mortgage loan and that a gross error may have occurred as the amount still owed on my home mortgage is showing as a Principle Balance owed {$99000.00}. I have made several calls to Roundpoint but cant seem to get an answer as to where my money is. I am concerned that my escrow money will also be mishandled.

07/25/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"On XX/XX/2020, I sent the following letter to Fidelitys Office of the President regarding the closure of my credit card account : My name is XXXX XXXX, and I was recently fortunate enough to be approved for Fidelitys Rewards Visa Signature credit card. I am absolutely thrilled. I felt that at my other bank, my priorities werent being considered and that their rates were too high and wait times to talk to someone too long. Meanwhile, with Fidelity, Im just in love with how I can view not just one account, but my investment, credit card, and other accounts in just one online profile! That really takes the hassle out of my day when I can see my finance accounts in one place. And I shouldnt even get started on your brokerage investment platform, because I could just go on and on about all the amazing gadgets, tools, and products available to me! And with the credit card, Im somehow getting 2 % cashback ( I dont know how you guys are able to do that, but thank you! ), I have an interest rate way lower than I used to get at my old bank, and I read that you can actually have your cashback rewards redeemed directly into your fidelity brokerage account! I dont think it could get any better than this because Fidelitys terms are perfect. But I have encountered a pretty big problem, which is why I write to you all. 

So, this is what happened and this is my understanding of the issue we have going on. I made a large purchase at XXXX ( I think on XX/XX/XXXX ) because I had to buy a whole bunch of household things ( like this one cute microwave, a comfy tent to go camping in my states wilderness parks, and a tow hitch so I can finally tow a trailer on road trips, etc. ). Thing is, initially my card got declined, and I received a call to verify the transaction. I figured that made perfect sense. I mean hey, my account with Fidelity is  new, Im making a big purchase, and your fraud team just needs to verify its me whos making this huge purchase. So, I talked to Fidelitys card team on the phone and was able to clear it up. Then, ( either the same day or the next day, I cant remember ) I again had to make a big purchase but at XXXX XXXX. This time I had to pay for some of my prescriptions and over the counter medications, as well as a big stock of health products ( like the shampoo I use ) since Ive been running low on everything since a few weeks after COVID hit us hard in Mississippi and around the country. I also had to verify this transaction too, so I spoke with another Fidelity team member on the phone and everything seemed like it was alright. But then I was transferred to a gentleman in a department I cant remember the name of ( sorry! : ( I know that would help ) and he told me there would have to be a manual review of my account. I figured this was alright too, though he did let me know I couldnt buy my stuff at XXXX at that time. It was a bummer, but I thought it was all reasonable and justified given the large purchases and me being new to you all at Fidelity. However, about a week later I called back in to check on my account ( I had tried to buy lunch and something on XXXX but it kept getting declined ). I found out that my account had been permanently closed because I was a suspected victim of fraud. To be frank with you guys, my heart nearly sank. 

Over the span of that conversation, I felt like I kept getting more and more bad news. I say that because it seemed like your credit card team just needed to verify my receipts at XXXX and XXXX ( or at least the attempted one at XXXX or the receipt from the other card at my old bank I had to use to pay for the medication ). Im not really sure, but it kind of sounded like the fraud people wanted to see that I wasnt buying anything like gift cards and getting trapped into a scam. The problem was, I didnt keep either of those receipts XXXX and against my Moms advice, too-I definitely shouldve listed to her all those times she told me to save them! ), so I would have to see if XXXX or XXXX could reprint them. By the way, on a little side note-I actually extremely appreciate Fidelity having my back with this stuff and verifying transactions with me to make sure Im not a victim of any kind of credit card fraud. Ive had family members fall victim to identity theft and from what theyve told me, it was simply unbearable. Furthermore, I dont think my old bank really cared about security and watching out for its customers at all. One time I called in advance because I had to buy an expensive generator and thought they might flag it, and the person on the phone said it wasnt necessary because their system lets just about anything through. Isnt that crazy! Anyways, they were a pain to deal with. 

But back to my issue at XXXX and XXXX. I was again hopeful I could get all this sorted out and be able to reap the benefits of being with Fidelity and their great terms until both XXXX and XXXX said they would not print any receipts or copies of receipts for me. It really made no sense. I offered to show my ID, to show my Fidelity credit card to them, but with no luck. I called both of their customer service peoples and went in person to the stores but always got the same vague response about security or customer privacy when I asked. I dont know what the big deal is seeing as how theyre receipts for my purchases, you know? Nevertheless, they wouldnt give me anything. 

Everything puzzled me and I had no idea what to do, which was why I gave you all at Fidelity a call today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to see what else I could do to help Fidelity and unfreeze/reopen my account. I spoke with a woman who unfortunately said that Fidelity really needs those receipts to make sure Im not a fraud victim. It was like I was backed into a corner with nowhere to go. And I definitely didnt want to go back to my old bank, thats for sure. But the wonderful lady I spoke with said I actually could write to Fidelitys high up Office of the President to request some kind of appeal so that I could use my card again. From my understanding, she said I would have to do what Im doing now as this would be my only recourse/avenue for trying to maintain my card account with Fidelity. So thats exactly what Im doing now, and what Im trying to accomplish. The thought of me going back to my old bank fills me with nightmares, let alone knowing that I found an amazing financial institution like Fidelity that cares about and watches out for me and I lost my relationship with them because of a big confusing mess. Therefore, I am respectfully asking you all at Fidelitys Office of the President to look into my file/account to see if I can have my account closure appealed. I guess thats all there is I have to say right now, but lastly, I want to wish your executive office and all those at Fidelity good health in these crazy times right now. I know Im finding immense comfort in staying close to my family as we have to stay inside and face a global pandemic together. Thank you for reading my letter and thank you for your time ( Im sure you guys are swamped right now! ). Thank you again. 

Best Regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Today, XX/XX/2020, I received the attached letter in response. However, I was expecting more information in response to my complex situation than just mentioning a short paragraph that allows Fidelity to close my account at any time. I tried to call in today at XXXX XXXX CT, but the Supervisor ( I believe in the general customer service department ) I spoke with couldnt or wouldnt give me any more information either. Im submitting this complaint because the letter I received in response to mine clearly didnt detail what happened and why Fidelity closed my account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,MS,391XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/25/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3764129

On XX/XX/2020, a charge in the amount of {$150.00} was withdrawn from my checking account and paid to XXXX XXXX. I contacted US Bank on XX/XX/2020 to request the charge removed from my checking account as I had previously removed authorization for XXXX XXXX to withdrawal from my account. The representative I spoke with understood my concerns, and advised the original stop payment was not done correctly and credited me the {$35.00} stop payment fee. I advised her I did not care about the fee, as I had agreed to it, but I need the {$150.00} back. She reassured me the {$150.00} would be removed within 10 days, and I would receive a form to complete and send back. 
I faxed the completed form on XX/XX/2020. I called US Bank twice to check on the status of my return. The second call, the representative advised my claim was denied. 
Please reconsider this decision. I did everything in my power to contact US Bank to remove the authorization and paid the fee to have the payments from XXXX XXXX stopped. If the stop payment was not done correctly or not done for all amounts, I would not have the knowledge as the consumer to know that. I am also very concerned additional amounts from XXXX XXXX could be taken from my bank account.

The credit card company, Wells Fargo & Company, resolved the dispute in merchant 's favor, stating that I am responsible for the full charge of {$64.00}, because I did not cancel the reoccurring charge, which is the auto pay feature I set up for the internet service plan, despite of the fact that XXXX informed of account balance of {$0.00}, and the fact that I wasn't able to use the full service for the billing period of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX.

07/27/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I refinanced my home mortgage through Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I sought a better interest rate and switched from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage. I requested private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) cancellation and a refund when I spoke to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, who were assigned to help me during the process of refinancing my existing mortgage. I explained that I had paid off PMI on the first mortgage and asked for assistance in cancelling the PMI and receiving a refund. They explained they would contact someone at WFHM in the PMI cancellation department. 

I received a letter from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage dated XX/XX/2020, stating that I was eligible for an estimated partial refund of {$620.00}. 

I received another letter dated XX/XX/2020, detailing cancellation options. The letter led me to believe I had already fulfilled the criteria for cancelling PMI. There were many different options given, and I felt I had fulfilled the requirements for almost every option. Specifically, I had already paid the fee of {$550.00} listed by WFHM for a home appraisal. I fully expected a refund of the PMI. When I didn't receive it, I contacted XXXX XXXX, who contacted someone in the company. The person he contacted stated that I had not fulfilled the necessary steps to receive the refund. I filed a complaint with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and received a response from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/2020 stating that "" the necessary steps were not completed prior to the loan being paid off '' and declining my request for a refund of {$620.00}. 

I believe this denial on the part of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is unjustified for the following reasons, and I ask that {$620.00} be remitted to me by WFHM as soon as possible : 1. Wells Fargo abrogated its fiduciary responsibility : Since it was in the process of working with me to refinance my existing mortgage, and I was in close contact with two individuals from the company, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, both of whom I spoke to about the PMI cancellation refund, the company had a fiduciary responsibility to help me successfully complete the refund of the monies owed. While two letters were sent to me, no one from Wells Fargo responsible for PMI cancellation ever contacted me to help with the process. Wells Fargo was obligated to take affirmative steps to assure the successful completion of the process since I had requested that help from them. Not taking those steps constitutes negligence on the companys part. 

2. Wells Fargo adopted completely different customer service approaches depending on whether they were collecting money from me as their client ( during the refinancing portion ) or being asked to refund monies to me as their client ( during the PMI cancellation portion ) : When it was a question of my paying Wells Fargo for a service, they were open, transparent, and communicative. When I was asking justifiably for money to be refunded, however, they used deliberately obfuscatory language and instructions to try to confuse me as their client and thereby avoid paying the money rightfully due and owing to me as the client. See number 3 below. 

3. Wells Fargo deliberately wrote opaque and misleading instructions to confuse the client and unnecessarily complicate the process of refunding PMI. To give a few ( of many ) examples : The language sent in the Wells Fargo letter of XX/XX/2020 suggests that, as client, I had already fulfilled the criteria required. On page 3 and 4, the letter suggests different cancellation options that require no action on the part of a client requesting PMI cancellation. 
The letter ( page 5 ) states that the price of an appraisal starts at {$550.00} for a single family residence. Since I had paid Wells Fargo {$550.00} for an appraisal that it had already conducted, it seemed clear to me that I had already fulfilled the appraisal requirement -- I had paid the {$550.00}. The letter states a client should use XXXX ; however, it does not state that the appraisal information conducted by Wells Fargo would not be passed along to XXXX for use in its independent appraisal. 
The letter leaves clients with different options, but with no clear explanation of which one the client should chooseor under what circumstances. It does not explain, for example, whether a client should request an appraisal for {$550.00} or a Broker 's Price Opinion ( BPO ) for {$100.00}. Since I had already paid {$550.00} to WFHM, it seemed beyond the expectations of any reasonable person to think they should have to pay that fee again. No effort was made to help clients decide which option should be chosen -- or whether they needed to choose an option at all. 

4. Wells Fargo unreasonably set an early 30-day period to complete its PMI cancellation process : in an effort to run out the clock, the 30-day period makes it virtually impossible for clients to comply with this accelerated schedule. This is in direct contrast to its mortgage refinancing process, which sets a limit at 120 days. This expedited 30-day time limit does not allow clients to complete the PMI cancellation process in a reasonable amount of time. It imposes an artificial limit without basis in law or statute. 

5. Wells Fargo does not explain the basis of its fees or offer any rationale for requiring them : As a client of Wells Fargo already, there should be no reason for providing these additional fees, especially when the client has already paid numerous fees to Wells Fargo for appraisal and closing costs. These additional fees are never explained or justified by Wells Fargo ; thus, the explanations are insufficient for clients attempting to comply with the requirements. The explanations are insufficient for the entire process, since the instructions do not clearly specify which options, if any, need to be pursued by a specific client. 

For these reasons, I argue that : ( 1 ) I have complied with all reasonable steps that should have been taken to complete the PMI cancellation process ; ( 2 ) all fault lies with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for failing its fiduciary duties in representing me and clearly explaining any specific, mandatory steps ( if any ) that needed to be taken to complete the process ; and ( 3 ) a full refund should be remitted to me in the amount of {$620.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TX,775XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3766403

07/24/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Hello there! 

I was supposed to get married on XX/XX/2020. Unfortunately, on XX/XX/2020, I received notice from the venue XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that they were going bankrupt and would not be refunding me the {$17000.00} that I had paid them to date in fully-refundable deposits. I contacted my credit card company ( Citi ) and was told generally that they would likely be able to credit me the amount, but that I would have to file disputes through various formats. {$4500.00}, which was the amount charged within the last XXXX months, I was able to dispute through Citi 's online portal. I have since received a permanent credit of {$4500.00} for that dispute. 

The remaining {$13000.00}, I had to dispute via a package that I mailed in to Citi. Prior to being able to mail it in, however, I had to collect all of the statements for both my card XXXX {$7100.00} worth - a {$4100.00} charge, and a {$3000.00} charge ) and for my father 's card, as he had paid {$6000.00} ( two {$3000.00} charges XXXX to our venue as a wedding gift. To do this, I had to speak to yet another round of Citi representatives, get my elderly father on the phone, and get his verbal authorization to proceed. I then bundled everything up and mailed it in via USPS certified on XX/XX/2020. I received confirmation through USPS it was delivered on XX/XX/2020. 

Over the months since then, I have tried numerous times to get someone to help me with my dispute. On XX/XX/2020 I was told they could not find my dispute package and that someone would reach out to me within 1-5 days. Nobody ever did. On XX/XX/2020 I call back, spoke to a manager and was told I would receive a call back within 2-4 days. I never did. I called many more times over the following weeks and months and was told it was in process and would be taken care of, but they could never give me any details. 

On XX/XX/2020, I finally received an email saying that a dispute for {$4100.00} had been opened and asking for additional documentation. I provided the documentation but requested confirmation that the other charges ( three charges for {$3000.00} each ) would also be disputed. I sent multiple emails and made multiple phone calls, but never received confirmation. I have since received email notices that my {$4100.00} dispute is working its way through the system, but I can not get anyone to tell me that anything is being done with the other {$9000.00} in charges that I provided documentation on. 

I am losing my mind. I have spent over 40 hours on hold or on the phone with Citi. They can not seem to call me back, email me, or otherwise provide any support for the disputes that I have submitted. 

Please note, the credit card I am providing on the following page is my current card with Citi.

08/07/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"On XX/XX/2020 I made my ( USAA/XXXX ) mortgage payment with an additional principal of {$460.00}. Initially, the USAA app on my phone reflected the new balance after a couple of days as did the "" My Accounts '' screen of the web application. A couple of days later, the balance on my mortgage on the phone app and web app screens was increased by {$460.00} to {$11000.00}. I went into the web app to check Payment Activity screen and noticed that after my payment was submitted, it was debited and credited many times, with the last debit eliminating my {$460.00} principal payment. My payment was submitted in a straightforward manner through the web application with the {$460.00} amount clearly marked to be applied to principal. 

On XX/XX/2020, I called the customer service number for the mortgage company and eventually spoke to XXXX XXXX, who said that "" the Payment activity screen is just not updating '' and that XXXX can not be held accountable for any balance that is part of my USAA app because that is not their screen, so if it's wrong, I should speak to someone at the bank about that. Then he told me that I should "" trust '' that XXXX understands that I only owe {$10000.00} and if I need an accurate printout of my balance, I would need to call the customer service number every time because it is inappropriate to rely on the web application. XXXX said he would "" get in touch with the web developers '' and then noted that he would only be calling me back if they called him back because otherwise, he was too busy. He did give me the name and number of his supervisor, XXXX XXXX, and sent me what he said was an official record of my payments, which differed from the "" official record '' I downloaded from the homeusaa.com. 

I called XXXX XXXX and she promised to have someone call me by XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/2020 to tell me when the discrepancy would be resolved. Ms. XXXX also told me I needed to "" trust '' XXXX. When no one called by XXXX XXXX  EDT, I called Ms. XXXX back and she told me that "" I swear '' that someone would call me tomorrow morning ( XX/XX/2020 ) at XXXX XXXX. She then reiterated that I needed to trust her. When there was no call by XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Ms. XXXX back and she had rerouted my call to an anonymous number, somewhere in Indiana with a voicemail that only gave the forwarded number and then beeped. This morning, XX/XX/2020, I  tried to call Ms. XXXX again and had the same result. 

I called USAA, the company with which I dealt ( I am a veteran and the mother of XXXX actively serving soldiers ) to obtain my mortgage. I spoke to "" XXXX '' with the executive resolutions team and she told me there is nothing she can do because "" I do not deal with mortgages ''. 

As of XX/XX/2020, my mortgage balance shows as {$11000.00} ( {$460.00} more than is accurate ) on the web application, the mobile app and the Payment Activity page of homeusaa.com.

I don't need a new credit card, have limits above XXXX on EACH of my cards and could easily pay cash. My husband and I were in the market for a new washer and drier, so I thought we would look at what they had to offer. 

I should tell you from the onset that I have a XXXX credit rating and a 40 year credit history. 
I am a XXXX and XXXX University and make a very solid XXXX figure salary. 

When I finally received my card, it took a bit, as like many people I have a fraud alert on my credit so no one can access my credit. I did forget about this, so I had to work with credit agencies. 

The cost of the washer and drier is about XXXX. The card, issued by Synchrony Bank, was for a credit limit of XXXX. 
As I indicated above, I am not some recent college grad. There is NO reason why the bank would do this. Who doesn't want to do business with me.

I check my credit report again and this same debt shows up on my report dropping it another 7 points because of the negative remark.

07/31/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Total Pages:17 Page:1 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington , DC. XXXX To : Whom It May Concern : I am writing you to seek your help in a matter which I shall describe in definitive detail. I seek your help because, I have prior to this writing exhausted all, of the conventional avenues of correction available to me. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX, I made my monthly credit card, timely, just as I have always done. A review of my record will reflect that I have never been the subject of a late credit card payment over 30 days late. This credit card was originally issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At some point in time apparently the credit union chose to sell its credit card operation to Elan Financial Services, located in XXXX XXXX, Missouri. The card number is XXXX and the card was issued to me, my name is XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Elan Financial Services reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies that the above referenced payment was late. The following is a chronological dissertation of the events and my efforts towards resolution. 

XXXX I spoke with XXXX , a customer Service for Elan Financial Services , working out of their Iowa Offices, to advise that the payment that I referred to earlier was still sitting in my account. 
XXXX I called Elan Financial Services for the second time to advise that the funds were still sitting in my account. I spoke with an associate in Card Member Services, who initiated a conference call to my banking institution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). A supervisor for Elan Financial Services, whose name was XXXX. She advised that her company, Elan Financial Services, had processed the payment incorrectly. She further advised that Elan Financial Services had processed the payment with the correct account number but had failed to process a needed suffix number needed for successful processing the payment. XXXX apologized for the error, refunded the applied late fees back to my account instantly, which was {$60.00} and assured me that she would resolve the issue. The dispute letter from Elan Financial Services Stated that the payment was return to me as a GESTURE OF OUR APPRECIATION FOR YOUR BUSINESS. ( which you can go back and request the phone conversation, that was NOT never mention ). In the letter that Elan Financial Services sent to me the letter Stated that the account was close due to the return payment. Which was totally not correct. XXXX also requested a letter from my Credit Union, If they could provide a letter on their letter head, confirming the availability of funds in my account at the initial time of processing. This letter was provided as requested. 
XXXX I spoke with an employee of Elan Financial Services whose name was XXXX , to advise her that the referenced funds were still in my account, XXXX advised that I had to file a formal dispute in order to resolve this issue, and that NOW my payment was sill not drafted and that I needed to file a dispute with Elan Financial Services XXXX 
XXXX I filed the dispute with the company immediately ( Elan Financial Services ) by the way of fax. 
XXXX I filed my first dispute by Mail and not with the company, I filed it by way of mail. 
XXXX I received a letter from Elan Financial Services XXXX which in part confirmed the aforementioned facts, stated in this letter but stated that the funds returned to my account as stated earlier, was simply a gesture of goodwill. 
XXXX I received a response from Elan Financial Services XXXX acknowledging receipt of my dispute. They requested additional supporting information. That information was supplied. 
XX/XX/XXXX -I filed my second dispute XXXX I received a response from Elan Financial Services , requesting additional Information.  That information was supplied. 
XXXX I filed my third dispute XXXX I received a response acknowledging receipt of the dispute and requesting additional support data. That data was supplied. 
XXXX I filed my fourth dispute A review in information available on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website and it reflects that there are over 1600 similar complaints on file against this company within a few months. In addition, If needed, I will reach out to the Office of the Attorney General and the XXXX XXXX   XXXX if I can not get any aid in this matter. 
I have suffered greatly as a result of this improper action. My credit profile has suffered a deficit of 89 points. This lack of corrective action is costing me money, damaging my reputation, as well as depriving me of the fruits of my efforts over a long number of years, caring for and protecting my credit profile and Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( including but not limited to Section 807-8 ) ( 623-b ) and Defamation and Negligent Enablement of identity fraud.  This has impacted my time, finances and is destroying my credit. 

I beseech you to assist me in whatever manner you can to aid me in resolving this issue.

08/01/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Here 's the most ridiculous story happened to me for my Amazon Store Card at  Synchrony Bank, I strongly recommend XXXX  non-competent bank don't do business to harm and fool the rights of consumers. 

Here 's what happened, there's a checking account I don't keep a lot of balance into, which I used to make payments to the Amazon Store cad, as not a lot of money going on over there, recently I got my new house and there're a lot of things I want to purchase from Amazon, due to I'm so busy recently, for these couple of months, there's are two times I failed to ensure the money in the checking which causing the fail of pulling the funds for payment, I re-submit payment right away using other banks, in general the payment history is perfect, no missing payment at all. In return for this, they closed my account without previous notice, without communicating their rules on rejected payment at all previously. 

This is extremely unreasonable behavior, and all my purchase plan had been screwed up as they refused to re-instate my account, and they need me to re-apply! Does that sounds ridiculous ... I've never heard a big bank with good reputation do things like that as I have so many different credit cards and never had that issue. No communications, just closed your account due to a very XXXX reason, and customer service really bad, nobody is helping. 

I don't understand the fame of Amazon, why they had chosen such a XXXX  bank for business?? Synchrony bank is really ruining the reputation of Amazon, if it's not recommended by Amazon, I won't do any business with such a type of bank, nobody had never heard of if Amazon don't use them. 

Now the key takeaway here is : 1. I don't think it's a really issue at all if you fail to ensure the sufficient funds at the bank to pay, I realized that and make payments using other banks right away. The point is I never missed any payments. 

2. The bank do whatever they want to close your account, they can literally make any rules that nobody had realized before, after the first rejection of the payment, they did not give me any warning at all regarding the possibility of closing the account. They only allow this happen once in a year, twice you are done, nobody can save you, and nobody will warn you about this when the first time, it's like a scheme!! 

3. As a good credit card company as I've went through these so many years, they've done a lot and trying to do more and more for their consumers to win business and win reputation, it's so funny that I see a credit card company couldn't wait to close their customer 's account, if I cost them a million dollars, yes everybody will, but do I? 

4. Due to the customer behavior change, every other credit card company will do more and more to satisfy the customer 's needs, they will even use AI to learn more about your needs to satisfy more, as I got my first new house and I need a lot of tools from Amazon,  an increasing amount of purchase during recent time is very reasonable and understandable, I'm trying to catch up with payments so I'm paying more frequently, but forgot about the insufficient funds as too much stuff going on. They don't offer any solutions other than re-apply. Do you think I'm going to spend my credit again on this bank? 

5. Be aware of store cards run by small banks. Big credit card companies like XXXX or XXXX, if they do things like that, they will lost their business absolutely. Those small banks don't care because they are protected by large retailers to guarantee their business, that does not seem like a good option anymore as those banks are really bad-operated.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,NY,117XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/01/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3775797

08/06/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,None,"Shellpoint Mortgage assumed responsibility as my new loan servicing company for the first payment due in XX/XX/XXXX. I learned of an issue with my timely made XX/XX/XXXX payment when I went to make payment for XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called Shellpoint to inquire about the issue and what occurred with the payment made in XX/XX/XXXX, at which time I was provided inconsistent information from two different representatives. Shellpoint reported my payment to the three credit bureaus as having not made a payment timely, although their records clearly show that I did make payment timely in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, in communicating with Shellpoint about this error, I was told that my payment was returned because the banking information did not match and that my banking institution returned the payment, neither of which was true. We confirmed my banking information, confirmed that I had adequate funds to cover the payment, and that the payment was made timely in XXXX. I asked for them to remove the error from the credit bureaus, had made this request more than once, called on the phone multiple times ( once with my banking institution on the line to confirm again for a second time my banking information which matched completely and to confirm that my banking institution did not return any payments ), and I submitted a detailed letter laying out the history and proof of a timely payment. I followed up because well over 30 calendar and business days have passed, and I have heard nothing. So, despite trying to get this resolved in an orderly way and being promised that I would get a response and a return call, none of this has happened. Therefore, I am filing a complaint with the CFPB to assist with rectifying this situation. I have attached my complaint letter and additional proof of the issue and my attempts to resolve it. 

As a secondary issue to note for CFPB to look into, which feels very suspicious in nature given Shellpoint 's history, Shellpoint seems to withhold additional escrow funds unnecessarily and improperly and conducts escrow reports frequently to justify their actions. I have never had this much money withhold in escrow. This issue should be looked into as well to see if other consumers have raised this issue about Shellpoint and also my escrow review and withholding that changed only when Shellpoint took over is suspicious. I have had three prior loan servicers and have never had this issue. Even the representative I was speaking to on the phone noted that this escrow review being conducted multiple times in a short period was highly unusual.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MD,206XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3782344

08/01/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I don't know how to categorize my complaint, as it has built over several interactions, but simply put I believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX, and/or Loancare ( subservicer ) is handling my account in a predatory manner, intended to generate consistent fees, and hamper my ability to dispute them. I am worried about ongoing damage to my credit, and frankly do not wish in any way to give financial support to what seems to be at the very least an unethically managed company. I have been able to successfully reverse at least some of the spurious charges, but I am worried that there are likely fees that I have missed, and I don't actually know what sort of hits to my credit I may have suffered as a result. 

I have had a persistently poor relationship with XXXX since my loan was sold to them, but particularly since Loancare began to be the subservicer of my loan. My mortgage had been sold once before, but the first two companies did not have any issues as far as I could see. Over the last few months the situation with Loancare has become an unworkable risk for me. During XXXX, I was laid off when my employer shut down operations due to Covid-19. There was significant financial confusion on my end at the beginning and I had a late payment due to an overdraft. I did remedy the payment within days of the issue. After looking further into it, it appears the late payment ( my one and only ),  was a result of mismanagement on my end, not an actual shortage of funds, so it was quickly resolvable. I am not sure exactly how it happened but over the course of my conversations with Loancare, as I was attempting to investigate what went wrong with the payment, I was placed on a forbearance plan. I did not request this. 

I should say, I am missing most of the specifics from the many phone conversations I have had in attempts to remedy these issues. I would like to request the XXXX and Loancare provide me with recordings of any phone calls regarding my account. I have not requested them yet, honestly because I am worried that the recordings could be simply erased in an effort to deprive me of evidence in a complaint. Loancare also appears to go out of their way to make contact difficult, as I will discuss more later. My hope is that by filing a complaint, I would be more likely to avoid their standard attempts to brush me off or get me to simply give up and accept the fees. 
I did not wish to be on a forbearance plan at any point, particularly because I feared that there would be unforeseen repercussions and complications. Again, I don't actually know if it was even discussed with me, or if I was automatically placed in forbearance due to some trigger that I don't understand. In any case I DO specifically recall being told by Loancare that I could maintain my automatic withdrawals on schedule so as not to fall behind on payments, which I was still in solid position to continue making on schedule and without interruption. I made the payment by phone, and attempted to reinstate automatic payments. I was led to believe that there would be no issue with that moving forward. 

As another aside, I should note, that automatic payments online are one of the very few options to pay your mortgage through this company without paying a fee. For example they charge {$12.00} per payment over the phone even if you use the automated phone system. They XXXX it up to {$15.00} if you do it through a representative. Obviously if you have an issue with your payment and need a quick resolution, you don't really have much choice. While I'm sure there's nothing untoward legally about such a practice, as a consumer, its a glaring red flag that this is likely a company built on nickel and dimeing it's unsuspecting customers. In the same vein, the automated phone system and customer service line is clearly structured to break the will of anyone in need of assistance. 
It's at least a 10 minute ordeal to sit through all of the recordings and selections before you can even start waiting in line for the representative. As I'm sure is easily inferred, that wait can be absolutely oppressive in length, and unsatisfactory when connected. On top of that, any representative you reach is inevitably in a different department than what you need. You can almost count on being blind transferred to a new representative at least once. That representative will need to be brought up to speed from scratch, and often may simply transfer the call again. In any given transfer, I would guess that approximately 20-40 %  of the time, the call is simply dropped, leaving you to start from zero each and every time. If you are calling about a complicated issue that requires a supervisor, or multiple departments, it becomes a serious barrier to be constantly transferred, when the failure rate per transfer is high. The time really adds up when you must relay a long story to each of these people, and have your information thoroughly vetted each timed. I have requested callbacks in the event that I am dropped. These callbacks never happen, even if you are dealing directly with a supervisor. One representative even told me that outbound calls are literally not even possible by the customer service department. I have requested that reps stay on the line to ensure that if the next line does not answer I am not merely recirculated into the general on-hold pool to start anew. It is simply not an accident the number of calls that are dropped or misrelayed. It is designed to get me to just suck it up and pay the wrongly assessed fee rather than waste the hours. I was once even told by a representative, that it is impossible to waive fees through customer service, that the only way to dispute any charge over {$15.00} is through a written formal complaint. Ironically, that representative did drop the fee I was questioning, leading me to believe that the lie was yet another attempt to inconvenience me to the point it was not worth disputing, so that they could siphon another {$82.00} fee. 
In any case, from the very beginning of the forbearance, I attempted over and over again to reinstate automatic payments. Each month, I would check to see if the funds came out on time, and discover that the payment had not been deducted. I would then spend the hours navigating customer service to see what the problem was with automatic payment. No explanation would be given, so I would make the payment by phone, and again go through the automatic payment setup, which of course takes a while to do. I would than be assessed an {$82.00} late fee, which I would request to have waived, due to the fact that the payment is not made ENTIRELY out of their failure to deduct the funds properly. This cycle continued month after month. Eventually I was told that during forbearance, and even for months after cancelling it, that automated payments were impossible to set up. Obviously, this information was not provided to me by any of the representatives as I provided banking details over and over to reinstate the process. 
After several months of this I just lost total faith in the company and have actually sought to refinance my loan with an institution that I can actually trust. I was willing to do almost anything to get away from this company and viewed the time and money spent trying to resolve this as sunk costs. I felt wronged, but it didnt feel worth it to complain further if I could simply get away. That was until I saw yet another fee in my XXXX statement for {$82.00}. The total fees for the month are {$160.00} although it is unclear where the second charge comes from. I simply cant take it anymore. I obviously would like the fees removed yet again, but I would also like to know exactly what fees I have been given over the life of the loan are and how that may have negatively affected my credit standing. I am happy to take responsibility for errors or issues on my end, but I just cant pay any more for an issue on their end, particularly when it seems to be an integral part of how the company conducts itself. At this point I strongly suspect there may have been other hidden charges along the way. Honestly it is more a matter of principle than the actual money. I think it likely that this company does this to untold other customers and I hate to think that they cushion their profits by repeating the same practice and preying on others like me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",VT,None,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/01/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3776011

We have called Macy 's credit card several times over the last six months, but have not obtained any resolution. 

Based several telephone conversations with Macy 's ( Citibank/XXXX  ) credit card representatives, the following facts are undisputed even based on the credit card company 's own account history and notes : 1. On XX/XX/2020 I decided to close my Macy 's credit card account. Because we had auto-pay set-up, we overpaid the credit card account by {$440.00}. 

2. Upon closing the account, Macy 's electronically refunded {$440.00} back to our checking account ( see attached transaction information from my checking account ). 

3. For some reason, on XX/XX/2020, Macy 's also sent a physical check ( No. XXXX ) for the same amount ( {$440.00} ) to us in the mail ( see attached ). We never deposited or cashed this check, and Macy 's has confirmed the same in several conversations through their customer service representatives. In fact, in response to our calls and according to their on records, Macy 's issued a stop order for this check on XX/XX/2020 ( again confirming that this check was never deposited or cashed ). 

4. Macy 's credit card has nevertheless continued to send monthly bills to us demanding payment of the {$440.00} plus interest charges and fees. See the last monthly bill we received, dated XX/XX/2020 showing a total balance of {$510.00}. 

5. More recently, we called Macy 's credit card on XX/XX/2020, XXXX, XXXX, 2020, and XX/XX/2020 in an attempt to resolve this dispute. They continue "" review '' our account history but have failed to provide any update or resolution. 

6. Despite our many calls notifying Macy 's credit card of the apparent error and our attempts to resolve it, Macy 's credit card reported our account as "" delinquent '' to all three credit reporting bureaus. My credit reports from all three bureaus shows that Macy 's account as the only one that has any negative activity/delinquency. As a result of this incorrect reporting by Macy 's credit card, my credit score has gone down almost 100 points -- from "" excellent '' credit down to "" good '' or "" fair ''. Macy 's  error has directly and negatively impacted my ability to get approval for a new home mortgage loan.

Said I would have to wait until after it posted ... then I ask Regions to put a block on my accounts to safeguard me and the bank from any more funds leaving the bank.. 
The next day informed the bank to unlock my accounts Now..Had scanned my pc for any lingering Malware. 
After numerous calls, emails, being on hold for hours..disconnected multiple times, They said they would in fact do that, but they have not done so and have been giving me the run around daily..this does not begin to show the terrible frustration from being bounced around from dept. to dept., person to person..Informed them I had many automatic .. payments that would be coming out of my account..Throughout this entire process they were given all needed id verification from me.They assured me there would not be a problem ... but..the auto payments were not paid and I began to get notices. 
They are going to ruin my credit by not solving my simple request ..their inefficient actions are unconscionable for a XXXX  dollar company and to treat their customers so poorly.. 
This issue could have been resolved in one ten minute phone conversation..but I have yet to get access to my accounts..The pandemic is no excuse for not being able to solve a simple request timely.. 
There are many more details ... too many contacts for me to list..too many emails..too many disrupted phone calls. One hardship to overcome was the bank 's policy not to give out direct phone numbers to the correct departments. 
It has been 11 days and I am still unable to access my accounts.

07/24/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"XXXX XXXX/SYNCHRONY BANK-Dispute issue that has negatively affected our longstanding excellent credit score by what was reported to the credit bureaus. 
Following are the details and timeline of a disputed charge on our XXXX XXXX credit card with Synchrony Bank that has dropped our credit score 50-60 points. We followed every step we were instructed to by Synchrony & repeatedly were charged late fees & placed in a Past Due status all the while being reassured by Synchrony that we would not & it wouldn't affect our credit scores. Our credit score has now been adversely affected right as we are applying for a new mortgage. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we disputed {$350.00} with Synchrony/XXXX  XXXX XXXX for an extended warranty purchased at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The furniture was delivered XX/XX/XXXX and extended warranty was to begin oXXXX year later on XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX we were still making monthly payments ( & had always paid more than the minimum ) when we returned home to Michigan from Florida ( where there are no XXXX  XXXX stores ) and heard XXXX XXXX XXXX had gone out of business. We called XXXX XXXX and only received a recording with no way to contact them. So we called Synchrony to dispute the warranty charge and then received a letter from SYNCB/XXXX   XXXX XXXX. The letter stated that the disputed balance would not be included in the minimum payment due & no interest will be assessed on the disputed portion of the balance. We continued scheduling payments every month. We were told on the phone we would receive a resolution of the dispute within 60 days by US Mail. 

The first month XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) of the dispute a payment of {$110.00} as was required on our statement was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. SYNCB only took {$40.00} & did not apply the rest, we assume because the balance on the undisputed amount was then paid in full. On XX/XX/XXXX we checked my account online and had been charged a late fee of {$29.00} because the minimum payment of {$110.00} hadn't been paid. XXXX called Synchrony and they stated I shouldn't have been charged a late fee and they would remove it, which they did and because it was before the statement date it did not show on the XX/XX/XXXX statement. The new balance showing was now {$350.00} which was exactly the disputed amount and the Total Minimum payment required on XX/XX/XXXX was again {$110.00}. 

The second month ( XXXX ) a payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX & SYNCB did not take any payment & again charged another late fee for missed payment. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called SYNCB about a late fee on our XXXX statement & they said they again would remove it. Total New Balance was now {$380.00} and statement now says Amount Past Due of {$29.00}. Total Minimum Payment Due for XXXX is now {$140.00}. It had now been more than 60 days & Synchrony said that due to Covid 19 it was taking longer than 60 days for a resolution and we would receive notice by US Mail when it was completed. 

The third month ( XXXX ) a payment of {$140.00} was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we received an email from SYNCB stating we attempted to process a payment for your XXXX  XXXX XXXXSYNCHRONY BANK account ending in # # # #. On the date your payment was submitted for processing, your credit card balance was {$0.00}. As a result, your scheduled payment has been cancelled. 

The XX/XX/XXXX statement showed credits, fees & adjustments of - {$320.00}. The New Balance was now {$59.00}. A credit from XXXX XXXX of {$290.00} was posted after the XX/XX/XXXX statement but stated it was posted XX/XX/XXXX, now showing the remaining amount of {$59.00} as past due! How can the credited amount from XXXX XXXX be backdated? We had still received nothing from Synchrony by email or by US Mail explaining a resolution, so XXXX called SYNCB in the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX spoke with XXXX who told me the {$59.00} would be removed & the account would not reflect that for 24 to 48 hours. She didn't know why the credit from XXXX XXXX was different than the disputed amount. The difference is very close to 2 late fee amounts, but I was told there were no late fees on the account. XXXX asked am I disputing the new amount and I said yes as the original disputed amount was higher. 

Later that same day XX/XX/XXXX we received an email from SYNCB saying "" A total minimum amount of {$60.00} is due for your XXXX  XXXX XXXX/SYNCHRONY BANK account ending in XXXX. Please contact us today to avoid the potential of late fees and further delinquency on your account. '' XXXX called SYNCB back & was told again everything was ok, there were no late fees, account is noted & everything will come off in 24 to 48 hours. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received notice that our credit score had taken a hit. After investigating we found the hit came from SYNCB/XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that we had a missed payment. My credit score went from XXXX to XXXX on XXXX  & XXXX to XXXX on XXXX. XXXX called SYNCB that day. I'm not sure who the first person was but I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX. I was told that I should not have been told that the {$59.00} would be taken off our account in 24 to 48 hours because that amount was in dispute & it would take up to two billing cycles to get resolved. She said she was sorry I had been misinformed. I told XXXX that this was unacceptable & I would like to speak with her supervisor, she said she could only send her supervisor a message & that that person would call me back. As of now XX/XX/XXXX I have not been called back & also have not received a letter pertaining to anything further regarding the original dispute nor the disputed balance remainder. XXXX also said I needed to speak with customer service about sending information to the credit reporting agencies to get this corrected. She said that in addition to disputing the {$59.00}, I also had to file a dispute about the information that had been reported to the credit bureaus by Synchrony. XXXX said she would transfer me to them but instead cut me off. You think she would have called me back, she did have my number but she did not. I then called back the same day XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  & spoke with XXXX who gave me the customer service phone number in case I was cut off again & then transferred me to XXXX at customer service. I was told that once we get a resolution to the credit bureau reporting dispute ( which will take 1 to 2 billing cycles but at least by XX/XX/XXXX ) we will get a letter stating there was an error. 

To add insult to injury we received an email later that afternoon XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  from XXXX   XXXX XXXXSYNCHRONY BANK account saying our records show you have not made full payment on your XXXX  XXXX XXXX/SYNCHRONY BANK account ending # # # # in over one month. Payment for your total minimum amount of XXXX is due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Out of total frustration XXXX went on line XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX & made the full payment of {$59.00}. We received an email that Synchrony had received a request to schedule a payment along with a confirmation number. Again that afternoon almost 6 hours after we made the payment we received yet another email saying "" Our records show you have not made full payment on your XXXX  XXXX XXXXSYNCHRONY BANK account ending in # # # # in over XXXX month. Payment of your total minimum amount of {$60.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Are you unable to pay? Call us. 

We finally received an email at XXXX XXXX that day saying thank you for making your payment & your payment has posted on XXXX What is still incomprehensible to me is how can you schedule a payment with a company, they dont take the payment out & then say you missed a payment & charge you a late fee? Then destroy your credit after numerous calls to their company assuring you there are no late fees that should have been charged, and that your credit wouldn't be affected as long as the amount was in dispute.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,MI,493XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/24/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3761510

I talked to a customer service representative via Barclay 's online chat service and was informed the company updated its terms of service so that beginning in XX/XX/2020, points may only be used on Uber services and that points are automatically transferred at {$50.00} to my UberApp. 

I've been a card-member for over 2 years and this is the last straw. This 100 % unacceptable. Barclay 's business practices are fraudulent, as this isn't the first time they've done something like this. 

Under the original terms of service, the terms they advertised and marketed that made the card appealing to me to begin with, points earned at restaurants and bars were 4 % cash back and all points could be redeemed for cash or credit to the account or uber cash. 2.5 years later, all of sudden bars and restaurants are worth 3 %, while the uberapp is worth 5 % ( something I don't use on a regular basis ) and all of my points I racked up over the years that I thought I was saving to be redeemed for cash, can now only be used on the UberApp, something I don't really use. 

This is bait and switch behavior and fraud. I asked the Barclay representative for a corporate office number to call and she said there was no number that I could call. I asked that a check be sent to me for the rewards points that I had earned, she said she could not do that. Unacceptable.

And his supervisor XXXX XXXX again by email, voice mail and several messages left with customer service agents. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was put on hold until I had to gave up after 56 min. 
When, my sales agent XXXX XXXX was selling me he was very attentive. After, Mr XXXX, succeeded, in misleading me to refinancing with Freedom Mortgage. 
He has not returned any of my calls or messages, since he closed the deal. 

I'm not sure what the fiduciary responsibilities of a mortgage company are but I'm sure there must be some regulations, about responding to a customer. 
How long can they successfully avoid a loyal, paying customer? 
To date I have been ignored. 
No one has returned any of my phone calls, emails, text and several messages to Freedom Mortgages automated message center. I left messages with customer Service agents, and the automated message center. 

I received, automated acknowledgement emails that my messages were received and that they would respond to me. 
The messages did not say who or when. 
I have not been contacted I have been ignored I believe l may have been targeted as an older customer and promised misleading statements until I thought I was getting what I asked for.

Since the covid 19 pandemic my income was drastically reduced, every single one of the companies I have credit cards with worked with me with the exception of theirs.

They have been mostly unreachable via their customer service number for months, long hold times and repeated hang ups.

Over the course of 7 months I have made countless inquiries to citi and was given false information causing my debt to increase in size with excessive fees, despite my attempts to resolve this matter with their customer service department. I was even told on numerous occasions to call back, when I explained if I called back at a later date I would incur another fee, something their representatives should be aware of. Instead of helping me to prevent this, they encouraged more time to pass so more fees would be placed upon my account. 

Even before this pandemic hit when I made a phone payment in XX/XX/2019 their customer service representative directly they told me the wrong amount due and proceeded to charge me a late fee for the following month.

He had a bank account at Citibank with the XXXX, IL branch location. I reached out to them ( along with 3 other banks in the area ) to close his accounts and withdraw funds about a month after my dad passed away and once I received the death certificate from the county. 

I had to call Citibank 's XXXX branch location 8 times over 1 week in order to make an appointment. I did not walk-in because I knew many banks were not taking walk-ins during this pandemic. Each time I called I was told everyone was busy. I finally got to the national line and they made an appointment for me with Citibank XXXX branch on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I went into the office, I was told they did not have a record of an appointment and to leave and make one over the phone. I insisted that I had booked an appointment and asked to see someone. They accommodated me and filled out a death certificate form and told me it would take 10 business days for their legal team and back office to close the account and withdraw the funds for me. 

As I mentioned earlier, I did this with 3 other banks - XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. Each of those banks were able to get me the money within 48 hours. I did not hear anything from Citibank for over 10 business days so I called them on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, and was told the representative who helped me only worked on Thursdays and Fridays so I had to call back Thursday. I told them it was imperative we receive the money in order to pay bills and that I was willing to speak with anyone but they said it had to wait until Thursday. 

On Thursday, I called multiple times until finally getting through to the representative. They told me the back office hadn't closed the account yet. I asked why there was a hold-up and how we could fix it assuming that there was an unpaid fee or something associated with the account. They said there were no problems and they would close it. I told them to please close it ASAP because we need money that we own to pay our bills. On Friday, I called again and they still hadn't closed it. I reiterated the urgency of this request and that it had been far longer than the 10 business days I was told and that every other bank did this within 48 hours. They told me to call back Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and have not been able to get through to anyone.

07/31/20,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"In XXXX of this year we approached USBank for a construction to permanent mortgage to build on our property in XXXX, TN. This mortgage includes myself, my husband XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my stepson XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and his wife XXXX XXXX. We have been working with XXXX XXXX at USBank. We agreed on terms through an email on XX/XX/XXXX. We worked through the process and we closed on XX/XX/XXXX. Since it involved 2 couples, my husband and I signed and notarized the documents on XX/XX/XXXX, then sent the documents via XXXX  XXXX to XXXX and XXXX to sign and notarize on XX/XX/XXXX. They were then sent via XXXX  to the bank. {$32000.00} was wired to the bank for Cash to Close, as indicated in the signed Closing Disclosure ( see attachment ). 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a phone call and then we received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that underwriting had written the down payment incorrectly on the Closing Disclosure, and we needed to send the bank an additional {$9000.00}. XXXX wrote {$1000.00} to be distributed to the builder for the original draw instead of {$10000.00}, which is what the builder requested. Of note is that this was 16 days ( 12 business days ) after the closing. 

The correct amount of {$10000.00} was written on the XXXX, so the Cash to Close there  is {$41000.00} ( see attachment ). We do have a copy of that. Mr. XXXX states that is also what is on the XXXX, but I do not have a copy of that to verify. Mr XXXX has so far been unable to get us a copy of that. The amount on the signed Closing Disclosure, of which we received numerous copies, has the Cash to Close as {$32000.00}. The bank received {$32000.00} from us at closing. We have received documents from USBank since then indicating the loan process is complete and I have even sent the first payment to them. 

We have corresponded with Mr. XXXX by email and by phone, and he stands firm that we are expected to pay the remaining {$9000.00}. The bank has agreed to give the builder the appropriate draw, and the builder has received that. The bank states we may pay the {$9000.00} at the end of construction. 

We have not received any official documents from USBank recognizing the need for us to pay {$9000.00}, all correspondence has been through email with MrXXXX XXXX and 2 phone calls. His regional manager was to be on the conference call on XX/XX/XXXX, but was not. We had set up a conference call with Mr XXXX and his regional manager for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a text from Mr XXXX at XXXX that he was trying to get a hold of his manager. We then set a time for XXXX, but did not receive a call until XXXX. We were not available at that point to talk and we called Mr XXXX back at XXXX. His regional manager was not in on the call. 

Mr XXXX has agreed that this is a fault of USBank, and not a fault of ours. 

We feel this has been handled poorly and in a very unprofessional way. We have not received any official documents of this error, or requests for payment. We do continue to get emails from Mr XXXX explaining the error in the documents. We would not be comfortable simply paying any sum without legal documentation of the error and indication of the appropriate way to rectify the error, although as we feel this is a USBank error, we do not feel we should be held responsible for it in any way.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,NC,280XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/03/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3772340

07/31/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a complaint to the CFPB about All Credit Considered Mortgage , Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX regarding mortgage closing issues and possible insurance/title/brokerage/attorney fraud. On XX/XX/XXXX the company closed my complaint with the following response, The company sent its response directly to the consumer because it could not confirm who submitted this complaint. To protect consumer privacy, The CFPB has not included the companys response in this consumer portal. You can contact the company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about its response to this complaint.This makes no sense because the submitted complaint included my name, postal address and email contact details. So, I am re-submitting the complaint and re-submitting my contact details : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I have just moved and do not have phone accessibility, so their complaint response needs to by post or email which are my only available methods of communication. 

Additionally, I feel that CFPBs purpose of disclosing fraud for the benefit of the public is not served by off the record phone responses. I have simply asked for a copy of my fully executed Deed of Trust on property, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX and confirmation that the mortgage recorded in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by ACC represented thru MERS has not transferred title to a 3rd party trustee without my consent, possibly from a XXXX XXXX  probate Trust that was opened fraudulently within my late husbands estate, Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX opened XX/XX/XXXX, as I discovered happened with title rights of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, despite me holding sole title under Rights of Survivorship. 

Attached you will see I have paid for owner 's title insurance listed in my sole name. Any title transfer to the Estate of XXXX XXXX has been done by fraud since no estate trust could have opened without my consent or knowledge per my late husband 's Will admitted to court XX/XX/XXXX. My husband 's Will clearly stated that I should be the Trustee of any Trust for residual funds not bequeathed to me in the Marital portion of the estate. There were no such residual funds. Myself as sole beneficiary and my children as heirs, have never been informed of a Testamentary Trust. Furthermore, Testamentary Trusts should be publicly recorded on the XXXX Probate online case look up as well as a recorded Trustee Deed in the public Town of XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is no disclosure of any Trust being opened, but two estates were opened for my late husband by the XXXX Probate Court. Fiduciary rights were given to Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Juris ID XXXX ) as a Guardian Ad Litem on  XX/XX/XXXX in a Will where the children had no assets and the Will not yet admitted on that date. Clearly my home at XXXX XXXX, owned outside of probate was transferred to a Trustee Deed for The Estate of XXXX XXXX, without my knowledge. The existence of a Trust is  furthered evidenced by the XXXX XXXX court letter instructing me to submit a Disclaimer of Trust before I could close the estate. 

My attorney that I paid to represent me in both the sales closing of Merwins property and purchase of the XXXX property, Attorney XXXX XXXX ( Juris ID XXXX ) has confirmed an estate held title of my solely owned property at XXXX XXXX without my permission or knowledge through a trustee deed, by filing XXXX  XXXX conveyance tax form. She also issued owner title insurance policy for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CT XXXX. I am requesting ACC to confirm this by sharing the fully executed Deed of Trust. Only a blank copy was included in my "" fully executed sales documents. Borrowers should have a right to know if title was assigned to a 3rd party. All consumers should be warned to ask for this written clarification If MERS is listed as the mortgagee since title transferred without their consent is fraud. 

Attorney XXXX charged me for my owner 's Title insurance policy and I fear I may have paid to insure a 3rd party Trustee to take away my title rights without my knowledge. This would be unethical to make me pay from my personal funds for title rights that do not belong to me and no one will disclose to me, possibly belonging to a Trust that was opened fraudulently. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( State License # Unknown ) has charged me from my personal funds for a home insurance policy for my XXXX property from my personal bank account. This too would be highly unethical if I was paying for a home owners insurance policy titled to a trustee who owns all property rights without my consent. XXXX. XXXX has issued a copy of the policy in my sole name, but did not even have me sign insurance binders until XX/XX/XXXX after the home sale was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I fear there is another policy in the name of a 3rd party title holder that I have paid for. 

So, I am asking ACC to please mail me the fully executed Deed of Trust to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX property with written confirmation that title rights are vested solely to me through my Warranty Deed.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"All Credit Considered Mortgage, Inc.",CT,068XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3773867

07/24/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"Two of the four mortgages I currently have are managed by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage ( WFHM ). WFHM put both mortgages I have with WFHM into their "" COVID-19 Payment Relief '' plan without any discussion or approval from me whatsoever. I actually found out about WFMH doing this two months after the fact. Fortunately payments for the two mortgages were set up differently because one was from a XXXX home purchase when I was stationed in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and the later, larger mortgage in XXXX for the home in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, for my tour at XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX The XXXX  monthly mortgage payment has been made via auto-bill-pay from my primary bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX  monthly mortgage payment has been paid via WFHM auto-draw, where WFHM must auto-draw the payment in the middle of the month, every month. Both WFHM mortgage statements reflected NO PAYMENTS being made to either account ; however, my primary bank account statements from XXXX showed the auto-payments sent to WFHM every month for the XXXX  WFHM. Yet the XXXX  WFHM mortgage statements reflected missed payments for XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Both my XXXX   account and XXXX  WFHM mortgage statements showed that WFHM did not auto-draft the monthly mortgage payments for the XXXX WFHM. 

Again, I did not contact, request, or elect any form of COVID-19 Payment Relief whatsoever. WFHM unilaterally stopped the auto-draw for the XXXX WFHM, causing the account to be delinquent and past due. 

When I realized this I immediately put the XXXX WFHM on auto-pay via my XXXX XXXX  account thus ensuring a payment of {$1900.00} was made the first week of XX/XX/XXXX. Even still, the WFHM XX/XX/XXXX mortgage statement for both mortgages reflects no payments being made. After multiple phone calls and emails with WFHM representatives ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and receiving phone calls from the WFHM Executive Office, I ultimately confronted WFHM via email with the fact they violated my consumer rights. I informed WFHM I have been more than reasonable in trying to assist them in resolving their error and their antics are causing damages in the form of inhibiting the purchase of the home I am currently under contract to purchase due to WFHM inaccurate and incorrect mortgage statement reporting. I asked WFHM to provide a report, statement, or letter that stated the payments on the XXXX and XXXX  WFHM accounts were either made or stopped in error on the part of WFHM and WFHM is working to correct the problem and while WFHM performs these actions in fulfilling their duties and  obligations to correct their errors, no negative interpretations or determinations regarding my credit worthiness should be made while WFHM works to resolve these issues. 

WFHM refused to support my request. I therefore advised WFHM since WFHM created the problem, WFHM needed to fix it, otherwise, I would file suit and see them in court. Examples of feasible fixes discussed were, based on a WFHM representative had explained to me : WFHM could move the payments that WFHM did not auto-draft to the back of the loan, making the loan a 30 year, and 3 month loan, vs just a 30 year loan. To support that effort, I provided the last two copies of my military Leave and Earnings Statement ( LES ), but I refused to fill out and submit the request for assistance that the WFHM representative said was required. The basis of my refusal being on the grounds that I never requested any assistance whatsoever ; I was not going to commit fraud due to WFHMs error or fraudulent actions. Currently, WFHM has removed the XXXX   mortgage from the COVID-19 Payment Relief Plan, and it looks as if I am 90 days past due for the XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX payments for the XXXX  WFHM. I can easily make the payments and bring the account current, but the XXXX XXXX Loan Processing Officer for the loan I am currently waiting to be approved for the purchase of my familys new residence in XXXX, XXXX in support of my orders to XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX has recommended I do not do that until we receive 100 % firm guidance from XXXX XXXX Underwriting that is the course of action they want taken. Otherwise, the XXXX XXXX Loan Processing Officer is concerned Underwriting might not approve the loan based on all the funds moving around at the last minute in attempts to hide something and create confusion. 

Bottom line, WFHM is coercing or even forcing some of their mortgage customers to have to call WFHM to figure out what is going on. I am sure WFHM is using these internally driven, self-inflicted increases in customer needs as demonstrated by their customer call volume to justify the subsidization to XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, whoever is subsidizing WFHM for WFHM 's increased financial risk and mortgage management needs of their customers as a result of COVID-19.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,SC,None,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/24/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3762926

Account number : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Hello, I received a letter from G.L.A. Collection Company, Incorporated dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called to verify the balance and explained that I had made arrangements to pay XXXX XXXX office with automatic payments from my bank in the amount of {$21.00} on the XXXX of each month. I explained that I had not received any communications from XXXX XXXX office and was unsuccessful with contacting his office to verify why the bill was sent to a collection agency despite on time payments. I spoke to XXXX of G.L.A and he could not verify the exact date that G.L.A obtained the balance of {$210.00} from XXXX XXXX office ( which I would think the letter that I received dated XX/XX/XXXX would not be dated the same exact day they took possession of the account ). He refused to contact XXXX XXXX office to verify the payments that were made including the most recent payment that was sent AFTER the date of the letter from G.L.A ( payment on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$21.00} ). I restated to XXXX that I could not reach XXXX XXXX due to XXXX XXXX having closed his office. XXXX stated several times that he would not assist with verifying a different amount and that my account would be reported to the credit reporting agencies by XX/XX/XXXX. I paid G.L.A. {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$65.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to XXXX XXXX, I contacted G.L.A again and they agreed that I could email them proof of payment. I emailed G.LA. proof of payment and called G.L.A after not receiving a reply after a week. I left a voice mail at the number that goes directly to XXXX 's line and he did not return my call. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to XXXX and he stated that G.L.A did not reply to my email, because they are no longer servicing the account. Initially, he refused to provide a letter that stated the matter would not reflect on my credit report. I asked to speak to a manager and then after being on hold for a few minutes, he said he was informed he could email me a letter. The problem now is that the letter does not reflect that I paid the {$190.00} sent that was owed and that the {$21.00} had already been paid. XXXX is refusing to state that they received the payments that I sent directly from my bank. XXXX is also refusing to verify if the payments were sent to XXXX XXXX. At this point it seems like this bill can resurface from G.L.A., another collection company or even XXXX XXXX, if he isn't aware that G.L.A obtained payments on his behalf. I am requesting that G.L.A be directed to send me a written notice that states the amounts and dates that payments were received as well as the fact that I didn't owe the additional {$21.00}. I owed {$190.00} ( which was paid to G.L.A. ) and not the {$210.00} that G.L.A has repeatedly threatened to put on my credit report.

There is a collection showing for {$650.00} from Ability Recovery Services referencing XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the first I had heard from either company. I contacted Ability Recovery Services via the XXXX, since I was afraid this was some sort of scam and didn't want to contact them directly. I advised them on XX/XX/XXXX that I would like some sort of proof regarding this alleged debt and that I had not received anything from them via writing or phone call as is required under federal law under the FDCPA. 

Ability Recovery Services sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX with a copy of a non-itemized statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing a balance of {$650.00} as past due with a different date of service, XX/XX/XXXX. This does not serve as verification of the debt as there is no indication as to what services were rendered or that I have agreed to pay any such services. They did not send this within the 5 day timeframe as required by FDCPA 809. 

This is not my debt. I received no services from XXXX XXXX XXXX on either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and I am concerned that the company has provided differing dates to different organizations. Ability Recovery Services has not only failed to provide the required notice prior to placing collections activity on my credit report, but they have failed to provide itemized debt validation as well as failed to respond within the 5 day period required by law.

08/06/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I've been a BB & T customer for over six years. BB & T is now part of Truist Bank. I opened my checking and savings accounts in XXXX, XXXX XXXX and now live in XXXX, XXXX   I've spoken repeatedly to my branch banker, BB & T 's XXXX  support team, and XXXX XXXX XXXX about these issues for over five months to no avail. 

For at least three years now I and others have encountered persistent problems not just in logging in, but in accessing BB & T 's website and mobile app at all. These problems have persisted with different internet connections, on different devices, in different cities, and at all times of day. About half of my attempts to log in and access my banking information since I last spoke to my branch banker have been unsuccessful. I have screenshots of the most common errors that I can provide on request, from the website ( where I am not able to access the log-in screen most of the time, including earlier today, yesterday, and the day before that ) and the mobile app ( which I was effectively locked out of for a period of three days last week ). 

This means that, a large portion of the time, I am completely unable to access card controls or other fraud-prevention features supposedly offered by Truist. I was not able to cancel my debit card and obtain a new one until two days after I'd lost it. And Truist elected to process a {$520.00} charge on that card over a week after it had been canceled. 

I frequently can not transfer money between my two accounts. I can not, with few and rare exceptions, monitor my daily spending or note suspicious charges on my account. 

In short, Truist is selling me a product it does not provide. 

My request to my branch banker XXXX XXXX in XXXX, which I repeated to a clerk in XXXX and via email last month, that overdraft protection be removed from my checking account has not been honored. As a result of this and my inability to regularly check my account balances, I've again incurred several returned item fees of {$36.00} each. 

XXXX has not responded to my email of XX/XX/XXXX. Those I have spoken to on BB & T 's social media and on the phone help hotline have gone so far as to insult my intelligence by denying that these problems even exist ( "" we are not experiencing any online banking issues '' ) even as I attempt to log in, on different devices and on different internet connections. 

I work in XXXX XXXX ; I can recognize the difference between a client-side and a server-side problem. BB & T 's servers are periodically refusing connections, sometimes to the website as a whole and sometimes only to the encrypted log-in page and/or the account view pages themselves. 

XXXX is a website that tracks website outages. It consistently, every day, has at least a handful of reports about BB & T.com nearly every hour. If others are reporting online banking issues to this specific website, I find it impossible to believe that Truist staff are not themselves aware of the problems, as they claim. Whether they are aware or not, it is their responsibility to maintain a usable website. 

To put it kindly, I find it reprehensible that Truist would continue assessing overdraft fees on its customers during a pandemic that has terminated many of their incomes. However, combined with Truist staff 's inability or unwillingness to provide a functional web interface, I feel that continuing to assess not only overdraft fees but even monthly maintenance fees is an act of fraud, or of false advertising at a bare minimum. 

I will not permit Truist both to remove the tools it claims to provide to help manage my finances, and take it on itself to "" punish '' me for supposed mismanagement.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,VA,229XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3782833

07/29/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"Good morning, not sure if I am talking to the right person. I have been trying to get help and advice from several places and no one can give a answer. I purchased a home in XXXX of XXXX  through XXXX mortgage for XXXX which was on a foreclosure. The home was worth at least XXXX if not more at the time. Our loan has been sold so many times and each time the loan sold they added the PMI which I called and asked why I was paying a PMI and they stated that our home was not able to remove the PMI, so I let it go not knowing what was going on. We have recently refinanced our home through our local bank. Which we found out that we should of never paid PMI as our home is worth XXXX. Also our last lender required that our escrow account to have a surplus in the amount of XXXX I thought was odd. That being said our new lender stated that we should be getting the escrow amount back as it is law, they have to send us our money back as we are going into escrow at this time that we had enough equity in our home to take the escrow out. I have just recently received a statement from our previous lender stating our escrow balance was only XXXX at that time I had called the last lender and asked where the money of our escrow surplus had gone, they stated that I needed to pay off the PMI of the remainder of the loan, and that they had to pay my insurance company my premium, which was already paid. As on the phone with them i was going though my escrow payments with the person helping me look through. We found a few problems. My house insurance was paid 2 times in the wrong amount and that they stated they got the bill from my insurance company for that amount. Talked to the insurance company today and they stated they never sent them a bill for that amount nor where they got that number from. this company is taking my money and will not return it to me. I am at a loss and not sure where to go from here nor who to talk to.

07/29/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I contacted Wells Fargo Bank about a charge that was not supposed to be on my business account Monday morning of the XXXX of XX/XX/2020. Over the weekend previous, I had zeroed out my accounts so that I could close them on Monday morning ( which I have been consistently trying to do for a while now ) the personal account I had, I was told there was no charge or service fee for that account. that is on record, so I intentionally left it open at XXXX balance since I also had a business account with them also and I had already opened my XXXX XXXX and was trying it out. When I saw the unexpected service charge on Friday, the XXXX of XXXX, I immediately called Wells Fargo to get it reversed. the young lady told me that when she attempted to reverse it, the system told her that it could not allow her to reverse it because they have already reversed numerous service fee charges in the past. All of which were levied wrongly and that is why they reversed them. So that was my last straw with WF nickel & diming me so I simply zeroed out my business account into my personal account so that it cleared the {$15.00} service fee then I immediately transferred the entire balance of my Wells Fargo personal account into my XXXX XXXX intentionally zeroing out both my Wells Fargo accounts so that I could close them Monday morning after the transfer is posted. 
I had already adjusted my XXXX and my other creditor accounts to reflect my no longer use Wells Fargo. I attempted to remove it from my XXXX account and still have not been able to. I was able to remove my Wells Fargo Bank card from my XXXX account however for the last two weeks every time I attempt to remove my Wells Fargo from my XXXX account it tells me that it can not process my request and to try again later. XXXX refuses to allow me to remove Wells Fargo from my XXXX account and does not provide any additional information as to why. But even on the remove account page, it tells you that even if there is any transactions pending that they will still process even after the removal so I should still be able to remove the account and they will still process. I had already added my XXXX XXXX bank account to my XXXX and I had already set my XXXX XXXX card as the form of payment so anytime I use my XXXX it's supposed to process the transaction from my XXXX XXXX account, not my Wells Fargo. I set that up a week ago anticipating this severance from them. On Friday I saw the {$15.00} service fee charged on my personal bank account at Wells Fargo so that's why I called to get it reversed because from my understanding I wasn't supposed to be charged a service fee for that account. That is on record. I do not remember the date of that conversation but it is in my Wells Fargo customer account records and it would coincide around the time where my balance was at a XXXX balance consistently I specifically asked her that and she said no you're not being charged for that. so Im not sure why I started being charged for my Wells Fargo personal bank  account but that was the straw that broke the camels back and prompted me to go ahead and close my accounts transfer it to my XXXX XXXX.. and when I do I would hashtag # XXXX in the memo. So, I do not know if they got offended by that, I do not know. I do not care. I had already started closing my accounts and removing my money from into my XXXX XXXX bank account. I was trying to wait until I got a feel for using XXXX XXXX, the reason I hadnt opened my business account there yet and I was supposed to this morning but now I cant because I have to dictate this letter of how Wells Fargo has treated me like old XXXX XXXX since Monday the XXXX of XXXX. 
So on Friday the XXXX of XXXX when the young lady told me that they can not reverse that {$15.00} service charge, I immediately possibly while I was on the phone with her, zeroed out my business account an put it into my personal account clearing that {$15.00} service fee that they randomly charged me and then I immediately started the transfer of that balance into my XXXX XXXX account I had already set up. 
While I was transitioning, I set all of my other recurring bills to my XXXX and had set my preferred form of payment to be XXXX XXXX and I made sure to recheck this all on Friday the XXXX. I know that once I submit the transfer, it is not going to post until the next day if that is a weekend, I would have to wait till Monday, which I was doing. OK, I've already updated everything so there shouldn't be any charges on my Wells Fargo accounts and I've intentionally zero out and sent everything to my XXXX XXXX bank account so I know that there shouldn't be any charges, no negatives, no nothing on my account, no pending, no nothing except the pending transfer. So, on Sunday night I finished working on my clients project and instead of cooking, I decided to order some food. I ordered my food using XXXX XXXX  and, on my XXXX my form of payment was my XXXX. OK, so I use my XXXX thinking OK I've already updated the information where it's going to use my XXXX XXXX card, not Wells ( even though for some odd reason I cant remove it ) so I'm fine with it Sunday night.. food did not get here till like 9 or something so I eat my food and wind down and go to bed. Monday morning, I wake up first thing on my To Do List is to call Wells Fargo to close my account. I call and lo and behold I hear your balance is - XXXX wait, what?!?! How?!?! so I was for one shocked to hear there was a negative balance on the account because there was not supposed to be so I even went and checked to see which form of payment I used ; I used XXXX, I make sure to check didnt I make XXXX XXXX as my set form of payment? Yes, I did. so, I called XXXX. They FORCE you to go through the resolution center. you CAN NOT talk to a live person about discrepancies in your finances on their platform. so they make you go through the resolution center, so I didn't immediately go to the resolution center, I instead immediately call Wells Fargo to put a freeze on my account since I can speak to them quicker than XXXX I spoke to a young lady and I do not remember her name but it's in their records of our call I spoke to a young lady that assisted me with opening up the claim and gave me the claim number and the reference number which I do have on hand when requested. I spoke with her and I explained the situation to her because at first she was like oh, we don't want to lose a client and I explained to her my reason for wanting to dump Wells Fargo is because of the treatment of their XXXX account holders and their crooked, corrupt and fraudulent behavior with accounts and mortgages. I could hear the cracking in her voice, my honesty really hurt her feelings. after some conversation, we did the business she gave him my claim number, reference number and everything and we hung up. so then I went onto XXXX and I sent them a scathing dispute on How I feel like they are in collusion with Wells because they refused to allow me to remove Wells Fargo from my XXXX account and they also dishonored my preferred form of payment as XXXX XXXX bank account and instead took the transaction from my wells account causing my business account to have a negative balance it was not supposed to have. The next day after that negative balance posted and after I filed the claim for this unauthorized transaction from wells through XXXX, I get the notification that they charged my account an insufficient funds fee. So I called them back on Tuesday the XXXX of XXXX and asked why would you all charge me an insufficient fund fee when I literally just filed a claim because that was an unauthorized charge? the lady told me that because the claim was in process, that they would still do the charges or whatever but once it's approved that they would reverse everything and that the claim takes up to 10 days. OK so of course I requested that they locked or blocked or whatever ... I ask them again could they lock the account so nothing else comes in or out. OK so this morning, Wells Fargo claims representative XXXX I don't know her last name but claims Rep XXXX calls me, she initiates a call with me to process the claim and she began the call telling me that all she needed was for me to answer 6 questions and that after I answered the questions they just need the dispute to go on file so that it would be in their record or whatever and that she would be able to revert the charge and remove the insufficient funds fee. However, as she was reading the notes that the previous Rep left the previous reps notes were inaccurate to MY concerns!! they sugarcoated it for their own comfort, so as he's reading this stuff I would tell her no, that's not correct.. my reason for wanting to close my account with wells is mainly because of the corrupt fraudulent behavior of wells and mainly because of how wells treats their XXXX account holders by calling the police on them. she said that she understood my concerns and all that and all she needs for me is to answer the six questions to go on record and she'll be able to remove everything and I'll be able to proceed with my desire of closing my account. I was standing in my bathroom as I was talking to her and she said I need to answer 6 questions and as she was saying that, I was walking into my living room and next thing I know she's saying hello can you hear me? hello And I say, oh wait, you can't hear me now?!?! please don't do that!!! and next thing I know the line is disconnected. I waited thinking of course she is going to call back since we clearly got disconnected. but nope ( more on that in a second ) so I am already mad by now, I admit. I called back and I am explaining what happens ... I do have a bad habit of cursing when upset but I would express that me cursing is not at them ; it is at the situation. the first person they just hung up without saying anything, the second person was more Focused on A curse word than the problem she snapped at me to stop cursing at her I said Im not cursing at you maam, she kept saying don't curse at me and even after I said ma'am I'm not cursing at you I'm just really upset at how Wells Fargo has been doing me ever since Monday she said well just don't curse at me so I said XXXX it and I hung up because I saw she had no intention on being helpful by her tone so I called again To explain all of what I went through including all that from today unfortunately, by this time I am saying XXXX or XXXX   or this XXXX  or something like that while explain this torture and the guy instead of understanding my reason for being upset, he too kept saying well I can't help you if you're going to use curse words so he didn't help me at all because he was more upset about a curse word than the 3 day torture from Wells Fargo and that call got disconnected. 
So, Wells Fargo made it clear today that their employees priority is an atmosphere free of cursing but all the fraudulent activity you can stomach. Their reps are more concerned about an upset customer using a curse word then they are about their employees mistreating their account holders so I can not get through to anyone. So, I calmed down and waited and I called back because this is a negative balance on my business account, this affects my business credit, they know this as well. It's as if they are purposely doing this to affect my business credit that right now is that a B, but this is going to make it go drop with them consistently refusing to clear my claim while adding insufficient find fees on a fraudulent charge and to let me close my account They are doing this on purpose. I feel like they are doing this on purpose, but I still calmed down and waited and called back to straighten this out. I spoke to the 4th person and when I gave her my name and number for her to pull it up, she said oh this account shows that it was denied. the claim was denied. now just to less than an hour or two before, the lady was telling me that she was about to put it through and approve it, remove and reverse everything but then she disconnected the call and next thing I know the claim is denied. So she hung up on me on purpose, she literally did not allow me to answer the questions that I needed to answer for her to even process the claim, she took my statements about how I want to close my account because of the way Wells Fargo treats their XXXX account holders.. she took personal offense to that then hung the phone up on me and then denied my claim without even accurately, righteously due processing it. THAT HAS TO BE ILLEGAL!! 
So after I explained to them what happened, the last Wells Fargo representative I talked to told me that she knows that I think my claim was not supposed to be denied but that's just how it goes and I will just have to hurry up and wait on XXXX to communicate. So they didn't even care that the lady hung up in my face refused to allow me to answer the questions that they needed to have on record to even process the claim and then she denied the claim without even attempting to call back. Not even considering had gotten accidentally disconnected because I was in the middle of talking as the line got disconnected she's the one that initiated the call, so I know she had my number, she didn't even try to call back AND she maliciously denied my claim and then they threw me away and told me that I have to work it out with XXXX. 
I must wait on XXXX so while I am waiting on XXXX to respond to the dispute that I submitted in the resolution center, this is affecting my business credit. they are purposely hurting my business credit because I am trying to remove my money. they purposely denied my claim because I told them that I was severing my business with them because of the way they treat XXXX people and then they commenced to treating me, a XXXX person like this. so, all I know is to contact you all and yes, I will be contacting the legal aid to see about sueing them for this. they can not keep on treating their account holders, their XXXX account holders like this with no repercussions. they can not just keep doing us like this.

08/01/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"On XX/XX/2020 I submitted a VA mortgage application to Amerisave for {$620000.00}. For two weeks we went through the process of loan approval. I signed all the disclosures and VA HUD addendums. I was given a floating interest rate quote of 2.625 and acknowledged all applicable forms for the loan. I paid the {$520.00} appraisal fee and scheduled an appraisal with the appraiser. Then, on XX/XX/2020, I was informed by my processer XXXX XXXX that the loan could not be approved because it exceeded the county limit of {$510000.00}. I immediately contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and was advised to notify Amerisave that the county limit did not apply to me because I retained full VA Home Loan eligibility. Therefore, there were no applicable home limits to my loan request. The VA would guarantee the full {$620000.00} loan. I was told by the VA representative to provide the following information : The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veteran Acts was approved in XX/XX/2020 which removed the limit for VA home loans. He reviewed my Certificate of Eligibility and stated that because I have full eligibility, there should be no reason to deny my loan due to hud county limits. I informed Mr. XXXX via email and was told that he would check with his superiors. I never heard back from him. I have experience disapproval also based on county limits from XXXXXXXX XXXX  via representative XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Others have denied my loan because of sudden credit score increase requirements. XXXX XXXX is attempting to process my loan application but because they can not get an automated approval from VA she is not sure she will be able to process the loan. She stated there are no reasons for the automated rejection so she can't understand why it won't go through. Now, I'm frustrated. I had approvals from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX prior to entering into my purchase contract, now company has found a reason to deny my VA loan application. I believe it is an attempt to stray away from VA loans due to the current Coronavirus concerns with government loans. Except for XXXX XXXX XXXX with a new XXXX credit score requirement, none of the companies listed above has given me a valid reason for denying my application. This is discrimination against veterans and the VA Loan system. Amerisave provided me all the proper disclosures and I provided to them all the requested documents. After talking to his superior to obtain final approval, MrXXXX XXXX stated they would not approve the loan due to the county loan limit which is not an issue as explained by the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. I've submitted at least 6 VA loan applications to different companies and no one other than XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX credit score increase, has given a valid reason for denial. It is discrimination against VA loans and veterans to continue denying VA loans. I am not the only veteran with this issue. In fact, I was informed by one of the XXXX XXXX XXXX   processor, also with a new XXXX credit score increase, that the VA has sent out letters informing these financial institutions to stop excessively rejecting VA Loan applications. What options do we have to get our loans approved? Additionally, none of the companies with new credit score requirements have updated their website and many still advertise their prior credit limit requirement. Which leads to confusion when submitting an application and companies continually pulling your credit report because you know your score exceeds the posted limits.",Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers,AMERISAVE MORTGAGE CORPORATION,NC,282XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/01/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3775485

I have now XXXX photos to Citibank as the rep I spoke to didnt care that I planned to frwrd the matter to the FTC all she would say it that it was, and I quote, system generated. So there isnt someone out there that controls that? Because what it looks like is someone is trying to get a $ XXXX fre every month from me, which they should just be honest about. The closing statement for the first month where I received the extra interest charge was 29 days and the reason for that is because the payments were made separately, so that even the agent argued with me and told me that I only paid a portion. Furthermore, theres a payment made at my bank that hasnt been attributed to anyone that is suspiciously close to the remaining balance and next payment. I havent looked into it yet, but if I do im certain Thats what I will find. Then, the following statement was given 32 days so that it could accrue extra interest. If you look at the statements the due date is before the closing date. So unsatisfactory. I can not believe I have to write in about {$20.00} because they are unfairly earned and the agents are unhelpful by calling it a SYSTEM. And then she claimed that I should JUST KNOW what and when I spent my money in. What if I did not? What if I am the type of person that needs help like that? So obviously you are not providing it or did not even train your agents to think about others like that but to top it all off your system requires me to be a mind reader so there is no way to avoid it if I buy something between certain dates.

07/31/20,Debt collection,Auto debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"This incident involves three companies : American Collections Enterprise , Inc. XXXX "" ACEI '' ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX  '' ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was in an accident where a XXXX insured driver, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was at fault. XXXX claim number is XXXX. XXXX paid for my car to be fixed and I was given a car by XXXX to use while my vehicle was in the shop. After returning the rental car when my vehicle was fixed, XXXX was billed for the amount of {$470.00} for the 16 days the rental car was in use. XXXX decided to only pay {$290.00} for what they estimated should be the price for a rental car. XXXX  only billed XXXX and I never received nor heard anything again after dropping the rental car off from XXXX nor XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that a derogatory account showed up on my credit report. The derogatory account was for a collection agency, ACEI. After investigating with ACEI  on what this was for, I found out that this was for the XXXX  leasing for the accident that XXXX was supposed to cover. ACEI sent me the paper work they had on file. That was the first time I saw the bill to XXXX for {$470.00}. A person at XXXX noted on the bill that they only received {$290.00} from XXXX. There was renter information on the bill for myself but all of my contact information was wrong, but it was billed to XXXX 's address for for XXXX to pay. XXXX should have taken care of this since it was their insured driver at fault. 

I contacted XXXX to inform them that their bill was showing up on my credit report and asked why they didn't pay this bill and how to resolve the issue. They argued that they didn't owe the full amount because it exceeded the estimated 10 days to fix my vehicle. I told them that it was out of my control on how long it took to fix my vehicle and the rental car bill included weekends as well. They realized that they had made a mistake and thought the bill was for 16 business days instead of the actual 11. They agreed to pay XXXX an additional {$140.00}. 

I contacted XXXX to make sure that they received the additional payment. They did receive the {$140.00} from XXXX, but an outstanding amount of {$120.00} remained on the bill because of derogatory fees. I contacted XXXX again to explain that there was still a balance on the bill. They refused to pay it because they don't pay derogatory fees. I thought this was ridiculous because these are derogatory fees for their bill they ignored. This is a bill to XXXX that was never billed to me and is now showing on my credit report. 

I contacted ACEI and asked if they would drop the derogatory fees since my renter information was wrong on the bill, I was never contacted by XXXX nor XXXX, and I was not at fault for not receiving a bill that wasn't actually billed to me. They agreed to wave those fees but an amount of {$44.00} remained. By this time, I could not deal anymore with this matter considering the amount of time I had spent trying to fix this. I payed the remaining {$44.00} even though this was billed to XXXX and they should be the one 's to pay this amount. I never thought I would be in an accident where I was not at fault and have to fight so much with the other driver 's insurance agency. If XXXX is doing this to me, they are doing this to many people. 

If I was billed for a rental car, I would have paid it. XXXX was billed for this rental car. They should have paid their bill!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"American Collections Enterprise, Inc.",DC,200XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3773350

I do not have a easy way to make monthlypayments, also I don't know when my monthly payment is due cos I can't access the account or know how much is due.

I made a payment of {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and called them on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a representative who stated i do not have to make any payment as at the time that there is a refund of {$39.00} reversal processing on my account and will put the balance in excess of {$14.00} and some cents which will be sent out as a check payable to me. 
Then i called them after 2 weeks to check my account status only for them to tell me 2 other late payments have kicked in, in the amount of {$24.00} each making it {$48.00} outstanding on my account. This outstanding is their fraudulent late fee charges. 


I need this removed and my account refunded back to XXXX balance as I have paid it of before they the {$48.00} fraudulent late fees within 2 weeks to my account.

Interesting though, their current marketing material doesnt seem to have this information anymore. So, it looks like i was lied to in order to open a card then without further communication to me they changed the rules.

07/27/20,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Back in 2016 my HELOC was sold to Specialized Loan Servicing and I had no idea it was leaving XXXX XXXX XXXX. We got a letter months later after even making payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX but the loan had without our knowledge sold to SLS. A month after we found it was sold, we began to send our payment electronically per a letter that came later. We thought all was good until we noticed that SLS was sending our payments back to our credit union. We called them and they said that the amount was not sufficient and that we had missing payments. We again tried to send payments of {$490.00}. but they would not accept them. At this point we were going back and forth with the reps on the telephone about our payment returns and they had no idea of what we were talking about. Again the payments came back and no one knew what we were talking about, but our Credit Union showed the money being returned. This went on for a few months and we tried to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to get them involved and ask why the payments were being returned. At one point a person we got on the phone said they had no record of our account! 

We became so exhausted with lack of response, no response and different responses from SLS and XXXX XXXX XXXX not helping and accepting payments, not sure if we had an account that we fell far behind in payments. As time went on with lack of any answers we had severe life changing events, taking care of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This began to drain us financially and took a horrible hit on our finances. We had to support all 3 financially. We also had major septic water issues to our home and had to put this on a credit card in the amount of {$10000.00}. We had to deal with medical issues ( XXXX ), which caused lack of work for a period of time. We informed SLS of all of these issues through letters and verbally. This was in hopes of a smaller settlement to just be done or a small settlement. At this point we are so far behind but still current on our 1st Mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX.h We have been working with a non-profit helper to be a communication between us and SLS for the past few years. Again, when you call you get different people all the time with different answers and no one has any idea where our paperwork is for modification. We get phone calls and the person on the phone has no idea of any paperwork or they say it's being looked at but they don't know who has it. We never never get anyone who can tell you what the process is for any modificaiton we have asked for. One day a few months back a letter showed- ups asking for {$20000.00} in a certified check. We called to let them know that we did not have such a large amount of money but we would be willing to take a loan out against our 401K to give them half of this to just bring the loan to a close. This was all that we had to give despite the fact that it would clean us our financially we were willing to just do this to close the loan out. 

We are now both getting ready to retire and our income will drop drastically. All that we're seeking to do is to pay them atleast a third of what we owe just to end this entire situation. We don't deny we owe the money but SLS is one of the most horrible companies we have ever had to encounter. The calls are non-stop and they refuse to make any sort of arrangement that will atleast allow for the debt to be removed. All that we ask is to pay them a 3rd so that we can cut all ties and move forward. We are now in critical times and money just to eat, pay utilities, keep a roof over your head and stay live is a priority more than ever. Taking one thing off your plate is all that most want to do. We are asking assistance to get a much lower payoff to end our dealing with a company which refuses to even acknowledge our pleas of settlement.

I called them to figure out what was going on which was when XXXX, from servicing for credit cards department, proceeded to tell me that they had decided to close my account.

The following morning I called USAA, reported the fraud, got a new card sent in the mail, and thought everything was ok. Thats the only thing I can think of that occurred fraudulent on that account ... so I asked her why am I being punished for someone else hacking my card?? She didnt give me an answer then proceeded to tell me that ALL my accounts were being closed including my checking and savings account and that I would receive a letter in the mail telling me I have 30 days. Continuing to ask why they are being closed and what I did wrong so I can avoid doing whatever it may be in the future, she kept stating that she couldnt give me that information. After that, I stated that I couldnt afford to pay off the full credit card amount within 30 days and asked what would happen if I didnt ... XXXX stated I would be sent to collections. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she said she had no supervisor I could speak with. Finally, I got transferred to XXXX, in executive resolutions department, who was no more help then XXXX. Refusing to give any information to why they were closing my accounts. I then insisted on speaking to the CEOs office ...

I have called FNBO twice, including tonight, the last possible day before I will be unable to log on due to the NEW 2FA policy, and they claim they can not waive it at all. 

Normally, I would quit such a business that does not handle my XXXX, but I will take a credit score hit for doing so. I have went back to paper statements, and do not want to have to go to paper checks when I have been paying them online for years, and only because of the policy change on XX/XX/2020 am I being prevented from using their online payment service. 

I ask that FNBO provide a reasonable accommodation for my XXXX in order to be able to continue to use the FNBO credit card as I have been doing for the last couple of years. I have NEVER forgotten the password, nor had it hacked. 

FBNO has claimed their process is "" industry standard '', but NONE of my more than 20 cards from many issuers that I have require this process.

08/06/20,Debt collection,Private student loan debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I spoke in XXXX of 2020 with Sunrise Credit Services about this debt. I said this debt should never have been charged to me as it was a mistake from the university. They told me to talk to XXXX and that XXXX university would then in turn talk to them to cancel the debt. They told me to wait a month. So I spoke with XXXX University who said they would speak with Sunrise Credit to drop my debt. The amount has increased since it went on my credit report and it also shows as late payments instead of just a collections. 

I was withdrawn from XXXX University and they registered me anyway. Then charged me for the classes I missed that I didn't even know I was registered for. If you look at my very extensive history of schooling - XXXX XXXX ( I have used school loans to pay for my education ). I have never, ever not told a university if I was no longer going to be a student. I have attended several other universities and have never had this happen to me. In fact, I use school loans to pay when I attend online and in-person universities. When I went to XXXX they did this two me where they registered me for a class and I had to call and tell them I didn't want it. It was like an automatic registration. Normally, you have to physically register for a class. 

XXXX said I owe them {$3000.00} for a semester that I did not even register for. I was not at the school during that time. Then Sunrise Credit appears to have changed the amount owed to {$3600.00}. When I spoke with XXXX to get this dropped they said that the collection agency added the extra {$610.00}. Which I thought was illegal. So when I spoke again with Sunrise they said they didn't add that extra that was what XXXX reported. Then they both promised that they would work this out and drop this false charge. It is not XXXX and I disputed it again on my credit report, but nothing has changed. 

I am worried that XXXX University is trying to get money from students by registering them for classes even though they stopped attending. I need to access my XXXX email to show proof that I contacted my advisor telling her that I would not be returning to the program. I never intended to return to XXXX, yet they still charged me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"SUNRISE CREDIT SERVICES, INC",WI,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3781725
07/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"On XX/XX/2020 I had made a payment with a late fee on my Citi bank credit card for the amount of {$330.00}. I am now below my maximum credit limit by {$260.00}. My Citi bank app ( where I pay my bill ) tells me my account balance is {$0.00}. I had made a call a few days later and the automated machine over the phone told me I am over my credit limit. I understood it as my credit limit decreased but I was not notified. I reached out to city at their customer service chat on the app and spoke to XXXX. XXXX told me ; and I quote "" I do apologize, however the only information available would be in the letter '' in regards to me asking XXXX how come my credit limit has been decreased without me being notified. I thanked XXXX for his time and made a call to city bank credit help number from the app link. I spoke to a woman after verifying all of my information whom did not tell me her name in regards to whom I was speaking to on the line, so she can not be named in this complaint, but when asked if she could inform me when my letter was mailed and when it should arrive approximately she told me it was mailed on the either the XXXX or the XXXX. My letter mailing date could not be pinpointed on a single day even though city bank 's system mailed it apparently. Then in my confusion, the representative submitted a request for a higher credit limit which she explained would not run my credit score at all. After a few more questions this representative informed me my credit balance was the same amount as always and had never decreased. At this time the representative informed me that my information that she had pulled up showed that I still owed {$47.00} because I only paid the minimum due with an interest payment of {$68.00} and a late fee payment of {$40.00}, which would equal {$220.00}. so I told this representative that it shows I still payed {$100.00} more than what she was telling me, so why was I still not getting an available credit on my credit card? Her response was to have me hold for a moment. She came back on the line and told me that my account that she had pulled up shows that I now owe {$110.00}. So now I have more questions because none of this made sense. Finally this representative informed me a few questions later that my card isn't working because the department that processes the payment ( not the believed to be automated system XXXX is closed currently and should go through on Friday. She stated that I should check again on the XXXX of this month. So now I'm left with more questions than I originally had in the first place, such as : Why was I told twice that my credit limit had been decreased and a letter was in the mail TWICE? 
Why was it not decreased, but I was informed that it was? 
Why was I informed that I owed 2 DIFFERENT payments due before my account was in good standings, even though the numbers she gave me did not account for the massive late fees I paid to put my account in good standings? 
Why is this "" department '' closed until the last day of the week/month, but not open during normal business hours the rest of the week? 
I had also asked the representative how I go about filing a complain through the consumer financial protection bureau because I felt I was getting the run around. She asked me what it was about and told me that she had submitted it for me, which was a lie because I'm filling it out now and its more than one question. 

My final question is why is it that every Citi bank representative I have talked to acted like they know nothing about Citi 's system, how to help me, or what is going on with my account, and they leave me with more questions? 

I am starting to feel like Citi does not actually care about its consumers because it seems like a fairly easy issue to fix or find an answer to, and after the representative told me what I was charged {$330.00} for, I am starting to believe that I have been charged {$100.00} for no reason at all. But she couldn't answer that question either. I have not been rude over the phone, I was very calm and willing to listen to what the representatives had to say, but Citi seems to not care if I get help at all.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OH,450XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/29/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3769982

07/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I requested a deferment through the CARES Act on my Citibank card. I was granted a deferment. During the last 2 months they continued to charge interest. I realized this was happening when I received an email that I went over my credit limit. Knowing I had not used the card, I found out it was because of the interest they were charging me that put me over the limit. I do not want to be over the limit and was doing everything possible to remain in good standing on all fronts so I called them to inquire what I could do to ensure that wouldn't happen. They said I could pay ( even while under the CARES Act deferment ) to ensure that wouldn't happen again during the deferment ( which for me is set to end on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid a sizable amount to not only bring my account under the credit limit, but to also ensure that I had some breathing room and I wouldn't go over my credit limit again due to interest charges. 
Fast forward to today when I receive a letter that my credit limit has now been decreased ... which is yet another thing to affect my credit score. I have spent hours of my life before and during the pandemic inquiring about how to get on a payment plan with 0 % interest so that I could pay down my balance. I was told that during the coronavirus deferment period, I can not be taken off of that status to consider another program. I was told to call back on XX/XX/2020. 
So, although they have made consumers believe we are 'safe ' from credit card payments during the CARES Act, I had to make one to keep 'current ' due to interest charges and then only to have my credit limit decreased. I will have to make another minimum payment in order to not be over my limit again next month due to the interest they will charge me for past purchases. Therefore, I have not gotten any kind of 'break ' due to the coronavirus deferment that I can't even get off of until next month. 
They seemed to have found a way to thwart a consumer 's desperate need to keep current and in good standing during this awful time where so many are out of work. Once I pay this card down I will never be their customer again. It is abhorrent that during this time when they pretend to help their customers, they are actually finding the other ways they can make money and hurt the consumer 's credit. Regardless of my current circumstances and deferment, they are betting on me paying so I will not go over my credit limit again. I would've just paid during the past few months if I knew this was going to happen. And, I would have ended up in better standing with Citibank. This was the exact opposite of what the CARES Act was meant to do for consumers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",GA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,07/30/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3771543

07/27/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I purchased a NetSpend card on XX/XX/2020 and loaded XXXX cash onto it at A XXXX store in XXXX, Texas. I am travelling and needed to book hotel rooms online. Upon registering the card, I first got a message that said, your funds will be available but we will not accept direct deposits until you furnish verify your identity. I did not want direct deposit and I called the number on the back of the card, I went through a series of questions about my relatives, my former addresses and associates. My account was unlocked and I charged a hotel for one night on XX/XX/XXXX and the next morning, my account was locked and the funds in it were inaccessible. The Risk Manager department at Netspend told me it's because they could not confirm my identity. I already had on the phone as is their verification method that I am familiar with, this wasn't my first card with them, so they had a lot of information stored and I confirmed that with them through questioning. Since I'm traveling, I do not have my Social Security card with me and they told me that I will be REQUIRED to submit 3 forms of ID -1 state ID, one Social Security card and proof of address. 
The Social Security Administration office is closed due to pandemic to all in person appointments and I was made aware that the only way I can obtain a new copy of my SSN card at this time is by putting my State ID in the mail to the SS Administration. I can not do that. I can not be without ID and that's unreasonable and unsafe! 
I am now living behind a shopping center, I lost my job, because I could not appear due to my funds being frozen. All because NetSpend is denying that My Money is My Money ... Not theirs, mine! 
I am going on a crusade against NetSpend. A warning label should be put on their sealed package that states, "" Warning, do not load this card if you need your money. '' If they want to now require people 's Social Security Card, they should be a proper bank and lending institution, then, they should be required to ask for that at point of sale ... Before loading money on to card!!!! 
I see they have done this to hundreds of thousands of people and were ordered by the courts to refund XXXX XXXX dollars to cunsumers that they have done this exact thing to a few years ago but they are still doing the exact same thing. You would think they would have changed, perhaps that XXXX XXXX was a drop in the bucket compared to what benefits they get through inflating their valuation. 
I can not even get home to get a returned check because, as I said, I am now jobless and penniless thanks to Netspend, I have lost my home and am in danger of XXXX. I have a good lawsuit and a video log off the harm and damage they have caused me.

08/05/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"In XXXX I advised my servicer, LoanCare that they were not timely processing my payments, were improperly assessing late fees, and taking my additional payments and applying them to the improper late fees instead of towards the principle. I requested an account audit, that the improper late fees be removed, that the additional payments be applied to the principle, and that the interest be adjusted. After several months, the servicer finally began addressing this issue in late XXXX XXXX. As a result of their account correction, the servicer removed 6 months worth of payments and sent me a notice of intent to foreclose on my property on XX/XX/XXXX and advised that those same 6 mths payments were passed due, that I was in default on my mortgage, and had to issue a forthwith payment of {$5000.00}. I thereafter had to obtain a certified statement from my bank along with the cancelled checks issued directly from my bank to confirm that the payments were received by LoanCare, that I was not in default, and had no late fees. I filed a Complaint with this agency and did not receive a satisfactory resolution.

While LoanCare was making account adjustments they issued a 1098 statement for XXXX that did not represent the 12 months of mortgage and interest payments I made. I filed a written request with LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX, have called and spoken with various company representative on at least 10 occasions with the last being on XX/XX/XXXX and to date they refuse to provide a corrected 1098 statement that represents the full 12 months of payments they received in XXXX. Additionally, they have begun improperly assessing late fees to my account again. I have advised LoanCare of this extraordinary burden, that i have been assessed additional fees by my tax accountant as a result of these delays, and that I am not able to file my XXXX taxes due to these delays. I have exercised extreme patience, have had to explain to the representatives the errors on my account because they do not read the account notations and instead of also correcting the new issues with the additional improper late fees, was advised that I had to make a separate complaint about the matter. Lastly, LoanCare initiated and granted forbearance request for my account when I have never request one. When I told LoanCare to remove the forbearance, advised that I never made a request either in writing, by phone call or any other manner, they advised that they were not sure why someone initiated the request on my account as they did not have a record of me making the request. 

This servicer does not keep and maintain accurate business records, refuses to timely address or address at all the errors with their business records for the accounts they service, and places the consumers at an extreme unfair disadvantage due to their failing and negligent business practices.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",MI,481XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/05/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3780676

07/28/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Near the end of XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, we were put on this loan modification trial period. 
This was not a modification that we requested or signed up for. In fact, to this day I still have no idea how we were placed on this modification, because the loan servicing company handling the account for the Mortgage company, has refused to this date to explain how we were placed on this Modification trial period. A Modification that had us paying roughly {$300.00} dollars less then our normal Mortgage payment amount of {$1900.00} At the time we were 2 payments behind after catching up from being further behind because of late Worker '' s Compensation payments. 

We were told that more information would be forthcoming, which never happened. At no time did we ever receive in writing any information that explained the whole process or what the modification would look like. Which I complained about in calls to the company during the whole modification process, from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I just kept being told that they were coming soon. What I did finally receive was final paperwork to finalized the modification, that I was never told was coming as I had not agreed to anything nor did I apply for the modification. They just expected us to blindly sign up for a modification that we never requested or knew anything about. A modification that we were without prior knowledge or intent placed upon. 
XXXX ofXX/XX/XXXX was the payment trial period and at the end of that trial period for the months of XXXX and XXXX RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing absolutely refused to take a Mortgage payment over the phone or online. I finally just wound up mailing one payment in that took a month for them to process causing more late fees. Late fees that I was charged during the modification process as well for the regular Mortgage payments because of the process that they placed us on and by refusing the payments it put us further behind. 

When we did not sign the paperwork that was sent and had notarized, 1.  ) because we had absolutely no idea what we were signing up for, because we were never given any written information about what the modification was, prior to receiving the final paperwork, how long the modification was for, the interest rate what the modification entailed and so forth. 2. ) We were never notified that the paperwork was coming and it was the XXXX XXXX holiday, nor were we told that it had to be notarized before hand. though I was told after wards that someone attempted to call, there was no voicemail left, as no one ever left a voicemail, nor followed up by email as was requested, due to to treatment schedule for the injury I sustained. We also found out later that we had other options open to us that were never discussed or addressed as options nor would they discuss other options, especially since we NEVER APPLIED for the MODIFICATION in the first place. 

When we, as it was put "" failed to sign '' the agreement that we never applied for, in order to go through the modification again, we had to turn in all this paperwork to get approved to be accepted for a modification that WE never filled out before. 
Now with the refusal to accept our Mortgage payments and the lower payments, which were not going to be our new payment, it was suppose to be roughly {$150.00} higher then the trial payment, we were now even further behind on our mortgage payments. 

Once I filled out the paperwork that was emailed to me I asked for an Address to mail it to, which they refused and insisted that I upload it to the computer and email it back. So I did on XX/XX/XXXX to the loss mitigation email address and to XXXX XXXX XXXX email. A little over a week went by and no word, so I called RoundPoint and talked to XXXX XXXX who told me that she could not find the paperwork and had me resend it to her, which at first we were having issue as the attachments being sent were not uploading properly on their end. The paperwork was sent by email multiple times XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Nobody giving me the Physical address to send the paperwork to and in fact XXXX told me that if I did, it would only start the process over again and delay it further. After this there was still no answer and took another three calls to find out that the application had been closed because they were missing paperwork that I did not know was missing because I was not told and through this time of process no one called to tell me or sent me any notice that anything was missing and after talking for more then an hour to this older XXXX american man in his late XXXX XXXX to early XXXX XXXX  who went through countless emails and notes told me finally that one page did not come through and told me what it was, which turned out to be a second income statement which was my XXXX payment which was identical to the second one that did process. since it was closed I had to start it over again, but in the meantime the foreclosure process was started. A process that never should have happened in the first place had someone not placed us without our knowledge or consent placed us on in the first place. 

Now here we are again with out the necessary information about the modification because it was mot sent prior to payment trial period and was not received until a week before the final payment, XX/XX/XXXX. The new copy that was sent was still not legible, as all the characters in the font that was used was smashed together like XXXX example : theendofthe ) some of the characters were even overlapping. It was then copied and pasted in a text, but upon reading, I noticed that sentences were not complete and RoundPoint was notified in writing onXX/XX/XXXX after I had contacted the Mortgage Company, XXXX XXXX and explained the issues I was having with their servicing company Roundpoint and how on XX/XX/XXXXI had in writing contacted RoundPoint and told them about the issue with the email from them and requested a new copy and how it took another 2 months. They have played middleman but do not want to get more involved than that because of the complaints filed about Roundpoint. Again they are trying to push through paperwork that we have not agreed to and know that we have other option which we have yet to receive the documentation that we not only requested but are also entitled to by law. 

1. ) I requested just after we found out that we had gone into foreclosure, the amounted needed to stop the foreclosure and was told it would take several days and up to a week to compile and then they would get back to us. DID NOT Happen nor did we receive in a statement to be mailed to us. That number was never supplied to us and we are still waiting. 
2. ) I requested that and KNOW that this is one of the available options, if we could get the back payments caught up what payments for the modification would look like. Have not received anything 3. ) I have requested the cash out option amount as my Worker 's Compensation case is coming to a close. Have not received. 
4. ) Requested loan modification details in writing through the mail as I will not accept another emailed copy. Last sent XX/XX/XXXX through the Mortgage Company XXXX XXXX and informed them that I still have not received that paper work as of XX/XX/XXXX, when I contacted them again about the issue and it was forwarded to the Servicing company by my main contact, XXXX XXXX, a Supervisor at XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ho has also informed her Direct Supervisor. 

The next issue is that since I was missing one document that I did not know about and the modification application that I filed for the first time was canceled because of missing income. But that the current application was accepted even though I was missing a piece of information that they requested, Yet between the two applications I filed a complaint against them, which they closed after accepting this application and never addressing the complaint and even went so far as to saying they needed more time to address and actually closed it 2 weeks early after the application was accepted and the individual handling the complaint, XXXX XXXX, was no longer employed by RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation,CA,946XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3768187

08/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I have two credit cards with Citibank. A Shop Your Way Card and a Citi Diamond PReferred card. 

My credit limit on my Shop Your Way card was {$3500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$2000.00} to Citibank because I am trying to pay down my debt so that I can improve my credit score. I have never been late with my payments for this card. On or abut XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank lowered my limit on this card by {$2000.00}. This in turn has made it appear as though I am using almost all of my credit line. This also has had a negative effect in my credit score. I have since made the following payments to Citibank for this card - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} - XXXX - {$500.00} - XXXX - {$300.00} Regarding my Citibank PReferred card. The limit on this card was {$5400.00}. I have been making consistent payments on this card even though I am not working and worked to get this balance from about {$5300.00} down to {$4300.00} between the beginning of XXXX and now. On XX/XX/XXXX Citibank lowered the limit on this card to {$4500.00}, again making it appear that I am using almost all of my credit line. They are indicating that they are using information in my Credit Report, but they are the ones who are causing my credit score to suffer because of these drastic reductions in my credit limit.

I would like for CItibank to remedy this situation so that I can continue to improve my credit score. They are intentionally hurting my ability to improve my credit rating.

I believe they are also using the fact that I informed them that I was impacted by COVID 19 as a reason to lower my credit limits when in fact I have not missed any payments with them.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NJ,None,None,Consent provided,Web,08/11/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3790246

07/30/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Near the end of XXXX, I reached out to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing to inquire about mortgage payment options on our personal home since we rely on income from our two rental properties. It was possible, in the near future, that our tenants may have difficulty paying rent and we wanted to know our options. I called the main phone number and reached a customer service representative. I was told that Shellpoint could not give me any options unless I filled out the online form. I filled out the form and waited for a response. Over the next few days I completed more research and realized that forbearance only put off the payments until the end of the forbearance period. This type of plan would not help me. I decided to not pursue any mortgage options through Shellpoint.

To my surprise, I received a letter from Shellpoint dated XX/XX/2020 stating that we were enrolled in the forbearance plan. I did not agree to that. On XX/XX/2020 I called my point of contact, but I could not get through and the mailbox was full. I called again on XX/XX/2020, XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 to get the forbearance cancelled and the automatic payments started again. 
This, in it itself, wouldn't have been such a problem except that I was going through a refinance of my personal home at the same time. The new lender saw the "" affected by natural disaster '' on my credit report and required additional documentation, assurances and time to evaluate. This credit report verbiage is code for Covid-19-related issues and the new lender was concerned about our ability to repay the loan. That verbiage should never have been on our credit reports and has resulted in payments of {$5100.00} in loan lock extension fees. 
I'm including XXXX documents. The first XXXX is the original loan estimate for the new mortgage loan on our personal home. It shows the lender credits as {$10000.00}. The second document is the closing disclosure showing the lender credits as {$5300.00}. The difference in lender credits is due to loan lock extension fees. The third document is a letter I wrote to the new lender explaining why our XXXX loan was erroneously placed into forbearance.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",OR,970XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/30/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3772605

07/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I am writing on behalf of my wife 's Amazon Prime Store Credit Card by Synchrony Bank. Twice this year, I had made an early payment which means I paid off the entire balance before I receive the statement at the end of the month. I want to help my wife build her credit, by paying on time and paying off the entire balance each month. 
We have XXXX young children including a newborn just XXXX XXXX XXXX, every time when my wife wants to purchase something on Amazon Prime, she would go and see how much available credit she has on her Amazon Prime Store Credit Card, and we would budget from there, just recently we had paid off a balance of {$380.00}, so we can purchase an item, knowing her credit limit is only {$400.00}. 
This is the second time this year, Sychrony decided to lock/hold down the account, the customer service rep, say the funds are held for six business day. The funds were withdrawn from our checking account, but Synchrony wont credit the account and release the funds of {$400.00} Total Credit Limit for us to use on Amazon Prime. 
My wife is fairly new to credit, we had not missed any payments on the account, but there were a few times, when we didn't pay off the entire balance, so I had a remaining balance, but most of the time payments were made on time, because my wife likes to shop on Amazon Prime. The first time I called and complained to Synchrony Bank, the representative said it was a "" red flag '', that we pay off the entire balance at the end of each month, but still wouldn't release the funds, so we can go and shop again on Amazon prime. 
Most banks, once payment is made, funds can be used again after twenty four to thirty six hours, but Synchrony bank, likes to hold the funds for six days after payment is made, which means we can not use the account, which is really inconvenient for us. 
Also I would like to mention Synchrony Bank originally gave my wife {$1100.00} Total credit limit and all of a sudden decided to lower the limit to {$400.00} without any explanation despite my wife 's credit history",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,NY,103XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3772459

07/31/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I have received the Shellpoint/NewRez letter dated XX/XX/XXXX in which Shellpoint provides false and misleading account of events and attempts to manipulate the numbers in order to avoid the liability of charging me a fee for the forbearance request and not providing the requested six month coronavirus forbearance extension. I will answer point by point to expose their fraudulent attempts : 1. Shellpoint states that our records show that the homeowner applied online via our web portal for Covid-specific mortgage assistance on XX/XX/XXXX ... and on XX/XX/XXXX we approved a three ( 3 ) month forbearance same day. This statement is false as I was repeatedly informed while waiting on approval that if I did not make a monthly payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, I would have been in default and would not qualify for the forbearance. I went out of my way to make that payment amidst the worst part of the coronavirus outbreak in XXXX. In fact, I contacted ShellPoint and NewRez in regards to coronavirus induced hardship multiple times, in writing, starting on or about XX/XX/XXXX. My requests were first ignored and then reduced to 3 months forbearance. The three months forbearance was approved on XX/XX/XXXX. Please refer to their initial email sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the forbearance was approved. ( See attached Exhibit 1 ) 2. Despite of the fact that Ive never missed a single payment, Shellpoint/ NewRez charged me a fee of {$7300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. My payment history is as following : XX/XX/XXXX received on XX/XX/XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX received on XXXX XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX received on XXXX XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX ) ( See Exhibit 2 ) So why does Shellpoint/NewRez is charging me {$7300.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX? ( As I was explained, that was a forbearance request fee which I found to be outrageous. I took a screenshot of their website that clearly shows my last timely payment made on XX/XX/XXXX due ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and shows a payment due of {$7300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) ( see attached exhibit 3 ) 3. Shellpoint/NewRez provided NO plausible explanation as to why they offered and promised ( confirmed by email ) the payments on forbearance are to be paid off at the end of the loan in a lump sum. and then failed to add it to the written agreement upon my multiple requests in writing ( see my original complaint ). 
4. Shellpoint/NewRez statement as to Please note, per the homeowners request for extension, on XX/XX/XXXX, we have initiated the process to extend the forbearance period for another three months. is completely misleading. I have contacted Shellpoint/NewRez multiple times to request a 6 months additional forbearance which Shellpoint / NewRez purposefully failed to address while playing cat and mouse  games. Besides communications, here is a written record of my communications pertaining to additional extension ShellPoint/NewRez ignored : A. XXXX XXXX communication and email to Ms XXXX ( request ignored, see attached exhibit 4 ) B. XXXX XXXX follow up with Ms XXXX ( request ignored ). 
C. XX/XX/XXXX communication and email to Ms XXXX ( request ignored ). 
D. XX/XX/XXXX communication and email to XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( All requests ignored ) E. Identical requests on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX sent ( See attached exhibit 4 ) As of today, Shellpoint/New Rez did not : *address my request as to a 6 ( six ) months extension on a forbearance *did not justify nor explain accessing {$7300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when all my prior payments were timely ( it appears that Shellpoint /NewRez increased my monthly payment amount during the forbearance but their numbers still do not match up to their misleading explanation as they now claim that they did not charge me the forbearance fees ) *did not include the discussed terms as to the payments on forbearance are to be paid off at the end of the loan in a lump sum. in the written agreement as agreed upon with their Loss Mitigation Team representative Ms XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",NY,11235,None,Consent provided,Web,07/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3774390

On XX/XX/20 using online chat I requested that I be refunded the credit balance by way of a check. I was told to expect the check in 7-10 business days.

On XX/XX/20, using online chat, I requested the status. I was told that the refund had been approved on XX/XX/20 and to allow 7-10 business days to receive the refund. 
I also called to speak to an account specialist who told me that a check was being processed. 
On XX/XX/20, using online chat, I was told that a check was sent on XX/XX/20. 
It is now XX/XX/20 and I have still not received the refund. I did receive a letter today, dated XX/XX/20, from Citi saying that a refund check has been sent and I should receive it in 10-14 business days. If the check had been sent by the time that this letter was written, why will it take 10-14 business days to arrive? 
This credit had been in my account for some days before I requested the refund. Therefore Citi had confirmed that this was my money, in my account, i.e. it was genuine. 
Why then do they have to review whether I am entitled to a refund of my money and drag out that process for two weeks. If indeed a check was raised and sent on XX/XX/XXXX, why have I not received it when I have already received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX? 
Clearly it appears to be Citi 's policy to hold on to monies as long as they can under the pretext of review, having to raise a check and the mailing process. 
It is totally unacceptable that Citi withholds a large sum of money belonging to me without cost or penalty. 
The interest rate on my account is 13.99 % APR. If I owe Citi any money, they will charge me interest. As they have withheld my money, they should therefore pay me interest at that same rate.

They have multiple complaints and lawsuits which looks like we will have to do as well. On XX/XX/28, I was called 4 times, the last 3 were from a number with my same area code from home where my family lives. I thought something had happened to them. I answered and a man who quickly ( before I could even hear him ) stated his name and that he worked for XXXX XXXX. I have never had a collections place call me and I pay everything on time so I thought it was a scam. I asked to provide more information and he would only say it was from an apartment complex I lived at 2 years ago. At this point I am thinking it is definitely a scam as he refused to answer any other questions and continued to threaten me, I tell him I am going to call the original debtor and he tells me to not do that and then rattles out my social security number, date of birth, and drivers license and asks me to confirm this info, I didnt know what to do. He then proceeded to tell me if he was a fraud, he would use my info and open up credit cards and just pay himself. The aggressiveness and the push to "" give me your credit card info now '' led me to believe it was a scam especially since I knew I had no outstanding debt. I hung up on him and called the apartment complex who told me that they were getting calls all day long about this and there was an error. People that lived there in past years were sent incorrectly to this new collection agency. They reassured me they would fix it and sent me the attached ledger to let me know I owed nothing and I was ok to ignore the caller. Later that night XXXX XXXX calls again ( the same rep ) and he continued to harass me when I tried to explain what happened to him. He said that he was going to report it to the credit bureaus which would ruin my credit, He said they would take action against me. He then said I could mail the ledger to their PO box but that its better to just pay it because it would take a long time to resolve it and in that time it would go on my credit. My girlfriend picked up the phone and got aggressive back with him and he placed her on hold so she hung up on him. We called XXXX XXXX and I spoke to a manager named "" XXXX XXXX '' who asked us to email him the ledger ( so apparently PO box isnt necessary ). But in my opinion the burden of proof is on them not me to prove to a company I never heard of that I dont owe anything to an apartment complex I moved out of 2 years ago. I got harassed for no reason and nothing is being done to the employee or the company for what I had to go through.

08/03/20,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"I had a vehicle loan with HMF that I was paying off at an accelerated rate by making extra payments. I decided I wanted to pay off my entire loan in one lump sum. When I contacted HMF to receive a payoff quote, I was told that some of my previous payments were being held "" in suspense '' because of how far ahead I was on my payments ( roughly 22 months. ) I was unable to get an accurate payoff quote because of this. I was told to generate the payoff quote online, payoff the amount that was shown, and that any overage would be sent back to me as a refund once the loan was paid off. 

I generated a payoff quote on HMF 's website on XX/XX/2020. The payoff quote was {>= $1,000,000}. I knew this amount to be higher than what I owed but again was assured it would be handled by the payment processing department. I wrote the check, sent it in the mail to HMF. 

I received correspondence from HMF on XXXX XXXX from a gentleman that was assisting me in getting the payments that were being held in suspense cleared. He informed me via email that he was able to do so and that my payoff quote should now be correct. I had already sent the check in the mail by that point but generated another payoff quote online just to confirm. The payoff quote generated on XX/XX/XXXX after payments were applied properly was {$9000.00}. This is about what I expected the payoff quote to be so I felt confident that all issues had been resolved and that the difference would be handled when the loan was finalized. 

I received a letter in the mail from HMF that my loan was now paid off and I was able to receive my title from the DMV. I have contacted HMF numerous times over the last few weeks to get an update on my refund. Each time I am told that there has been no update from payment processing and there is nothing further they can do. 

The difference between what I sent to HMF ( {$10000.00} ) and what my corrected payoff quote amount was ( {$9000.00} ) is {$1000.00}. That is the amount I am owed from HMF. 

The last correspondence I have from HMF was on XX/XX/2020 from the same gentleman that was helping clear my payments via email. He confirmed that I would be receiving a refund and that he was "" working on the refund now '' but explained that due to COVID19 accounts payable is working from home and processes are behind. I feel that I have been more than patient during this time and would simply appreciate an update on this situation and would like to receive the money I am due.

I was able to call them today XXXX and speak with employee XXXX, who politely looked into the matter and let me know I would be refunded the XX/XX/XXXX payment they took from my checking account. 

( I have had this happen once before with another card, XXXX VISA, about a year ago. For XXXX, this seemed to be a timing issue, but it should be completely avoidable with proper policy and systems changes. ) Most importantly, when I pay the minimum payment TWO WEEKS before it is due, I should not have the card company pulling funds from checking account. 

Needless to say, it makes it hard to plan for paying things like rent and utilities when a creditor violates an agreement and takes more money than is required. 

While I will get my refund, I do not want this to happen again EVER to me or any other card holder for any company. When minimum payment is made OR any payment is made that exceeds the minimum payment, then the creditor has NO RIGHT to take another payment. 

I would appreciate your looking into the matter. This is an especially difficult time for people who can't make two minimum payments for the same card for the same month if they have another card or other responsibilities due that month, too. 

Thank you for your assistance.

08/09/20,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"With reference to XXXX the complaint was closed however this is far from over. It still is not rectified. Here is why : Firstly it should be noted that I received two final account statements with the SAME date posted on them but two very different sets of amounts and totals. If the final account statement was adjusted, why is the date the same and why did Professional Debt Mediation use the higher statement amount for posting to my credit? In addition, after receiving two final account statements with the same dates, why did Professional Debt Mediation refuse to remove this erroneous collection from my credit due to an obvious conflict of amount owed. This alone reeks of unethical, unprofessional and unlawful business practice but there is more. 

Secondly, Professional Debt Mediation who is not the Magistrate Court of GA and has no authority to deem what is due to XXXX XXXX stated and I quote She is obviously responsible for the Dispo fee since her information was referred to an attorney for eviction. This is significant because under Georgia law there are requirements for evicting a tenant, which in this case were not met. In fact even though I requested the eviction notice, papers and copies of the filing on several occasions before I moved out, they were never delivered to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX or the Court. Therefore it would be in your best  interest to remove this erroneous collection from my credit bureau reports. 

Finally and equally significant, according to the statements you forwarded to me, you received final account statements for an address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXX. I had a rental agreement for and lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXX. This debt therefore does not believe to me. It would be in your best interest to remove this erroneous collection from my credit bureau reports. 

I should also note that I left XXXX XXXX XXXX, before XX/XX/XXXX, and not because I bought a home but because I was in two car  accidents one in XXXX and again in XXXX and was no longer working due to medical issues. XXXX XXXX the then Manager of XXXX XXXX XXXX was informed of both accidents, but obviously unconcerned, which is evident in those wholly inaccurate final account statements she prepared and actually used to try to bring me financial harm. Due to all of this additional information, it would be in your best interest to remove this erroneous collection from my credit bureau reports.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Professional Debt Mediation, Inc.",GA,300XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/09/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3786184

08/05/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Date : XX/XX/XXXX Time : XXXX MT Company : Wells Fargo Bank Amount disputed : {$350.00} Issue : I was making a cash deposit in a local ATM, when in the middle of making the transaction of depositing eight bills of {$50.00}, the ATM machine got stuck and it started beeping, displaying an "" error message. '' I waited for about 5 minutes and I finally got a receipt from the ATM proving my deposited amount of {$400.00}. I immediately called the help phone line posted on the ATM to verify this and a Wells Fargo representative got on the line with me. He reviewed my account and I logged in to my online banking app in my phone, and the recent transactions of {$400.00} shown as "" check deposit '' plus another {$50.00} amount as "" cash deposit '' were shown. The Wells Fargo agent verified this and promised that this cash deposit will be available within the next business day. Not until Sunday, I checked my online bank account and {$400.00} were deducted as a "" cash adjustment. '' I called Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX and the Wells Fargo Claims Office wasn't open so I had to call again on Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Due to very long waiting times and inefficiencies to transfer me, I had to call Wells Fargo a total of 5 times regarding this issue and spent over 3 hours on the phone with agents that were not helpful in resolving this matter. The last agent claimed to have created a claim case for me but they never deposited the disputed amount, claiming that the ATM couldn't find my cash deposit of {$400.00}. She also said that the bank will not use video footage for their claim investigation. I emailed Wells Fargo via the secured message center in my online banking application once on XX/XX/XXXX and three times on XX/XX/XXXX. Finally a manager of the claims department said that she couldn't provide much information over email and that she didn't find a claim on my file. After I requested to have a direct phone line for a manager so I can speak with management regarding this issue, I was given the wrong extension line, and as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I called 3 times to a dead phone line. As of tonight ( XXXX ) at XXXX MT, Wells Fargo has deleted all records of my email exchanges with them ( which were available earlier today ), leaving me only with email notifications sent to me stating that they have received my previous online messages. 

I'm frustrated and disappointed at how Wells Fargo has handled my claim case. We are experiencing a recession and this bank is fraudulently withholding money from my account when I made a cash deposit to an ATM. If this happened to me, I can't imagine this happening to other people that might difficulties understating the bank system, are economically disadvantaged, have no English, or are not aware of their consumer rights. I have been a costumer for Wells Fargo since I was XXXX  years old, have a excellent credit score, and this issue has never happened to me. 

This situation has left me with a very bad Wells Fargo experience and has wasted many hours of my time. I plead the CFPB to investigate this claim so this doesn't happen to me or any other consumer.

07/25/20,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"XXXX XXXX : A brief history I was born and raised in Colorado. After a few tries at college I decided to try a career as an XXXX XXXX. Growing up I had a flair for decorating. I had some initial success working for an XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and before the age of 21, 2 of my projects were published in the Sunday home section of my local newspaper. 
I decided to attend a 2-year program to become a XXXX XXXX XXXX. To pay for my schooling I went to work for a XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I feel in love with the profession. I worked for several florists in XXXX XXXX before moving to XXXX, Colorado. I was fortunate to work for Special event florists that recognized my talents and I began refining my personal style. In XXXX I won the XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX  at the State florists convention. 
I met my partner XXXX after moving to XXXX Colorado in XXXX. He worked for XXXX XXXX, a grocery wholesaler. He was on the fast track to move to home office which meant we would be moving for several years. We moved to XXXX, New Mexico in XXXX, then back to XXXX for a few months then we moved again to XXXX, Alabama in XXXX. 
For a few years I worked at a flower shop in XXXX, but I yearned to be part of the XXXX flower scene. XXXX has a storied flower culture. The wealthy ladies of XXXX went to XXXX to learn flower design and brought back the techniques that when coupled with the local greenery created an extraordinary culture of flowers and an iconic look called the XXXX XXXX. A handful of the original ladies who learned from their English teachers were even featured in a book entitled XXXX XXXX XXXX  published by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. It would be XXXX in XXXX where I would I opened a tiny 400 sq. ft shop in XXXX XXXX. I drove an hour each way from XXXX to be part of that scene. 
The shop in XXXX was only meant to be a way to express myself and keep myself busy as XXXX and I would be moving again. In XXXX XXXX found out he was XXXX positive. After an agonizing year of treatment that left him severely debilitated, he passed away in XXXX. At 30 years I lost the person who believed in me and my talent. Before he died, he borrowed money from his mother against what would have been his inheritance, together with savings and credit cards I was able to open my XXXX XXXX. He also knew the darker side of my personality. Back then I had what some might call a short fuse. I often quit many of the florists I worked for out of frustration and anger. There was something at work inside of my brain that I couldnt control or comprehend. When I went to work for myself everything suddenly changed. I had a handle on my mental health for the first time in many years. 
The owner of the 400 sq. ft building I rented added on an additional 300  sq. Ft to accommodate my growing business. By XXXX I had moved from the 700 sq. ft location to a 1500 sq. ft storefront in XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, eventually moving to a 3000 sq. ft space. Again in XXXX XXXX. By this time, I was an in-demand XXXX providing flowers for social events. 
I had many firsts for a XXXX XXXX man in XXXX, providing the dcor/designs for : XXXX XXXX, providing floral content for XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX   magazine and others. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, traveling with them to their yearly conventions throughout the United States XXXX XXXX, publisher of XXXX XXXX among other magazines. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX most prestigious fundraiser in XXXX. 
The XXXX XXXX XXXX An Alabama XXXX inauguration Alabama XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And many weddings and social events. The people and many corporations in XXXX had embraced me and my work. 
When I told my parents, I was moving to XXXX they were very concerned. They had a secret they never told me. I was not XXXX at all. I was half XXXX XXXX XXXX. My parents had adopted me after I was placed in their foster home. My birth mother, XXXX was born to a family in XXXX, Utah. When she was XXXX years old her mother passed away. Her father was overwhelmed with his 7 children and the decision was made to put the children up for adoption. She and her brothers and sisters were sent to live with various families. My mother and her sister XXXX were sent to XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They did not want/like my mother. In fact, she was sent back to her father 2 times. At XXXX years old my mother gave birth to a still-born baby girl. The father was XXXX XXXX, her adoptive father. He had been XXXX XXXX her for years. When she was XXXX years old, they decided to get rid of her and she was sent to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There was nothing wrong with her but during that period in Colorado there were no social services for children. People would simply leave unwanted children with them. When she was XXXX, she was XXXX by an XXXX American orderly, my father. I was taken from her at birth and placed in a foster home run by XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I was later adopted by XXXX and XXXX. At XXXX years old I found out I was adopted. The origin of my beginnings gave me great anxiety. I wondered why my mother did not want me. Why did she give me up? At the age of XXXX I finally understand my emotions and anxiety all those years. I was always looking for love and acceptance. 
When I opened my shop and through the subsequent years, I found the love and acceptance I had always been searching for. The everyday operations kept my mind busy and alert and the planning and execution of large events gave me a sense of accomplishment. I have a box that I have keep with me with notes from my clients. The overall theme of each note focuss not only on the professional work I performed but also the pleasure of getting to know me, with many expressing what a kind man I was. I felt blessed to be recognized as a good steward of the resources entrusted to me. 

My Dream In XXXX I had saved enough money to buy a piece of property in XXXX, Alabama. The property was offered by XXXX and XXXX XXXX, a local couple who owned XXXX, a small eatery in XXXX. 
The property was a perfect fit for me. I could run the business in the back and have a showroom for my event decor. Eventually when I retired, I planned to rent the property so that I could retire and be able to travel and pass the property to my family. This was my American Dream. I understood that financial freedom would allow me to pursue many opportunities that had alluded my own parents like traveling. 
In XXXX I signed the mortgage for the project with a construction budget of XXXX from XXXX bank with an interest rate of 6.5 %. At the time I owned a home in XXXX that I purchased in XXXX for XXXX. I improved the property adding a new kitchen and an extensive garden that included a koi pond. The Garden was chosen as a stop on the exclusive XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was also featured on the cover of XXXX XXXX. I sold the property for XXXX and realized a profit of XXXX. Selling my home was a requirement of the loan. XXXX XXXX, my loan consultant was adamant I use that money to purchase merchandise to sell in my new store. 
When the building was finished in XXXX the builder, XXXX builders revealed they went over the construction budget by XXXX. I had been required by XXXX to hire a construction supervisor and was also required to give them a XXXX contingency fee should the builder go over budget. I thought I done everything right. By this time XXXX had merged with Regions. XXXX, my contact at XXXX XXXX left before the merger and I was given a new contact at Regions, XXXX. It was shortly after that when I heard from XXXX. She advised me that Regions would fund the extra XXXX, but my interest rate would change from 6.5 % to 8.5 %. My mortgage payment would go from XXXX a month to over XXXX a month. A difference of XXXX! WOW! I had proven I could afford the XXXX a month but XXXX for 20 years would be a real stretch. I tried reasoning with XXXX. I proposed adding the XXXX to the mortgage, adding the XXXX to the back of the loan, anything but changing the interest. She wouldnt budge. I tried obtaining a new loan from other sources but with no luck. Even though I did everything right I was punished because the builder went over budget. For so many years I had given XXXX everything I had. Whenever I was asked to donate, I donated. Whenever anyone needed help, I helped. I thought all the good will I had shown my customers and XXXX at-large would come back to me. I took this action personally. This did not seem like the XXXX I knew. A place where despite the history of oppression, those who valued my work opened their arms to me. 
The anxiety that I had been able to keep in check for years became unbearable. I remember the day shortly after I had moved into the new building when XXXX showed up unannounced. She told me that unless I signed the new mortgage, I would lose my building. Backed into a corner I unwittingly signed the mortgage. I always understood that when one is in business everything is at-risk. Anything can happen, but I never dreamed that an institution whose very business is to aid borrowers would treat me with such ill regard. 
One problem after another came my way. That same year XXXX XXXX XXXX forgot to put my listing in the phone book. People still used the phonebook in XXXX. No new customers for a year. Many of my customers thought I went out of business. Little annoyances became big issues. I had to cut the hours of my assistant XXXX who took orders and did some of the book work. She got upset and went to work for XXXX. She called my customers and told them I fired her. More than 50 % of my customers left. Then the XXXX recession hit. Barring what happened with XXXX which was a result of this issue highlights what can happen in business, why everything is always at risk. I had weathered many storms over the years but coupled with my crippling mortgage these problems created a nightmare situation. 
Up until this nightmare I felt so blessed and thankful. This black-brown kid from a poor family with a humble beginning raised by parents with a XXXX grade education had finally made it. The sense of satisfaction I had from owning my own business was such a grounding force for me. But before I knew it, I was clinically depressed. I started using anti-depressants and stimulants to keep me going. By XXXX my whole demeanor had changed. I was angry, battling side effects from the prescribed drugs and constantly contemplating suicide. I had always been a social drinker, but I even tried drinking during the day. I tried anything to escape. I knew that drugs and alcohol were the refuge of the disaffected, but I was powerless. My partner XXXX was a recovered alcoholic. He had been sober for 10 years when we met. The reason he had become an alcoholic was from an early business failure he went through. We had talked about the conditions that had contributed to the demise of his business. We had discussed at length the issues I might encounter when I opened the business. I thought I had covered all my bases, but like many minority businesss I had always been underfunded. I didnt have multiple streams of income ; I did not have family to borrow from like XXXX had been able to do. Through the lens of time I can see things differently. 
By XXXX I was so angry I went to the Regions corporate building in downtown XXXX a few days before XXXX and demanded to talk to the president of the bank. I was eventually escorted upstairs and talked with several people from Regions. I was reassured I would receive help after the first of the year. I did but it was too little, too late. The bank would eventually sell the loan to a debt collector who would call me and say things to put me on the defensive. Telling me what a shame it would be to lose such a nice building. I listed the building in XXXX and it eventually sold in XXXX. I remember the scene at the lawyers office so clearly. The lawyer handling the closing made a point of sharing that the owner would be receiving a special interest rate thanks to a special program. My heart was so heavy. I had been begging for years for help and it seemed like the only people who received help where the ones who didnt need it. 
We can look back at the interest rates being charged in XXXX and see that they were in the 6 % range. If you are white and well connected or rich maybe they were even lower. What I do know is that 8.5 % was too high. It was punitive. 
The events leading up to this time in history helped me to find my voice. One of the worst things that happen to people who are marginalized is that they lose their voice. 

The cries of XXXX XXXX that he could not breath went unheeded by those in charge. 
XXXX XXXX killed XXXX XXXX by putting his knee on XXXX XXXX neck for XXXX minutes and Regions had their Knee on mine for 6 years. Its difficult to put into words the despair brought on by the wounds of unfairness. Whats worse than losing your life? I would argue losing your dream! Death is difficult for those who are left behind. But once you are dead you feel no pain. I had to relive my pain every day. 
XXXX XXXX from XXXX, Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. 
Dreams sometimes take a lifetime to achieve. Mine took 40 years. And yet almost overnight it was destroyed. To have ones life work dematerialize before your very eyes is demoralizing in every sense of the word. 
Regions and XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX I challenge you to listen and take up my cause. Your bank has announced that it wants to use its resources to address XXXX XXXX, inclusivity and advancement. 
From an XXXX article. Regions XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX said it is the companys responsibility to use our resources and expertise in ways that address disparities and create positive change. 
I submit to you that the actions your bank took by raising my interest rate was neither fair nor reasonable. Raising the interest rate on my loan put an undue burden on my business that in turn put an undue stress on both my physical and mental health. Borrowers like me have systematically been forced to accept unfair treatment by financial institutions who back their customers into a corner. Neither public interest nor the interest of the borrower is served by such treatment. The people you serve both black/brown or white deserve better. Their dreams matter as should the dreams of all who live and strive to provide a build a better XXXX and a better world for themselves.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CA,920XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/25/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3764286

07/24/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"The issue at hand is the re-evaluation process for credit limits with Citi Bank Credit cards. 

in general this complaint is to address the unfair practice of report pulling to reduce credit limits.

This practice creates a cyclic problem for consumers due to the following : Card 1 : had a XXXX limit in XXXX of XXXX Card 1 : was reduced to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX, just XXXX dollars over balance. 

this drastic reduction significantly raised utilization and inversely decreased credit score for having over 95 % utilization, thus raising risk factorization. 

Card 2 : had a XXXX limit in XXXX of XXXX Card 2 : had a XXXX limit in XXXX of XXXX,, about XXXX dollars above balance. 
Card 2 : had a XXXX limit in XXXX of XXXX, about 200 dollars above balance. 

Requested the balances be reinstated by citi bank, citi bank responded with calling XXXX  credit reporting. 
Also, using the automated "" increase request '' was denied, system stated balances can only be increased every 6 months. 

This predatory practice of lowers limits just above balances is damaging to consumers because there is no control metrics to in place that protect the consumer. Credit score Hemorrhaging affects not just credit cards, but housing and employment opportunities as well. 

example of existing issue : Citi see a score change, Citi reduce limits Citi increase utilization to almost maxed out, score decrease significantly Citi see dramatic score change, Citi reduce limit threshold just above balance again.

07/30/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Regarding : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ; XXXX, SC On XX/XX/2020 I made a partial payment online towards our XXXX mortgage in the amount of {$410.00}. I have a confirmation number for that amount and a receipt for it. On XX/XX/2020 Shellpoint Mortgage withdrew and UNAUTORIZED AMOUNT of {$1300.00} from my checking account which caused overdrafts of NINE transactions resulting in overdraft fees totaling {$250.00}.

I immediatley contacted the bank to which I was told to contact the mortgage company directly, which I did. The customer service agent seemed concerned and remorseful and told me that she was putting in a request for the return of the {$1300.00} and would take 3-5 business days, a request for the overdraft fees to be paid to us for {$250.00}, and investigation as to why this happened when it clearly said {$410.00}, and a request for a supervisor to contact me within 48hours.

Well the only thing that did happen was I received the refund of the {$1300.00} 3 weeks later. I have been fighting every week to have the overdraft fees they caused to refunded to us to no avail. There have been over 9 phone calls and 6 emails and I have only received ONE return call from someone self proclaiming to be our assigned Point of Contact 's supervisor and 2 emails back from I don't really know who -- I emailed our POC XXXX XXXX, who doesn't bother to reply or answer his phone, or return voicemails. Mr. XXXX XXXX claimed to be XXXX XXXX 's supervisor -- I spoke with him on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX ( 21 days I've waited for someone to contact me about this nightmare ... .21 days ). His words to me were "" let me work on getting you your money back '' and he REFUSED to give me his direct number, email or any other contact information. 

The initial call I was told the overdraft fees would be returned to me. 
2nd call I had to make on XX/XX/XXXX I was told I had to provide proof the overdraft happened and that fee 's were incurred. I sent over the bank statement showing Shellpoint ILLEGALLY withdrew {$1300.00} and the ledger balance being negative {$110.00}, followed by all of the negative transactions in the ledger balance column and the banks overdraft fees on XX/XX/XXXX {$36.00} and XX/XX/XXXX {$210.00}. ( for security XXXX redacted names and amounts of the vendors that were paid, but left unaltered the ledger balance column 3rd call XX/XX/XXXX I call again and am told that they wanted "" proof that my account was not negative to begin with ''. 
( well if the withdrawal of {$1300.00} only resulted in a negative balance of {$110.00} then that means my beginning balance was {$1100.00} but for some reason they wanted more. So I sent the balance before their ILLEGAL withdrawal of {$1300.00}, showing it was a positive balance of {$1100.00} unredacted, along with the unauthorized withdrawal and bank NSF fees. 

I receive an email telling me that they wanted proof of "" both withdrawals '' being taken out -- I have NO idea what they are saying so I call again. I can't speak with a supervisor, our Assigned Point of Contact, the self proclaimed supervisor of our Assigned Point of Contact, the payments department that handles this refund or anyone else except the customer service representative that I was speaking with that was only reading notes. So, I emailed our Assigned Point of Contact, XXXX XXXX. I received an email response from XXXX XXXX saying, "" as we discussed give my department time to work on this '' -- which did NOT address the issue I emailed about this new email that very day. I call again and request a return call from a supervisor, which is supposed to be done within 24 hours, or so I was told. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I receive an email from someone, I have no idea who, the return email address is from XXXX XXXX, but as I said, I've emailed him at that address and have had XXXX XXXX reply instead, so really it seems like an open email to whoever. 

The email is now telling me yet again, to send the bank statement "" completely unaltered ''. It's just been one thing after another after another with them. They are coming up with excuses to not do what they are supposed to do, as promised, for whatever reason. Maybe they think I will give up and they won't have to pay, I have no idea. 

I questioned XXXX XXXX about what his investigation department found was the reason for such an error, and I was brushed off completely. Every time I call I ask why this happened and NO ONE answers To date : I have called on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX To date : NO Refund of our overdraft fee 's. We have since closed that account that they have tampered with and STOLE that money from. But we have yet to have any refund of the overdraft fee 's. 

Where is the accountability?? WHY and HOW is a mortgage company ALLOWED to STEAL an amount from our account that is greater than authorized?? HOW and WHY are they allowed to cause such financial hardship and they play these ridiciulous and unnecessary GAMES instead of just refunding the overdraft fee 's they caused??? Why aren't they accountable??? IF I stole that money from anyone 's account I would surely be arrested and put in jail, but a big mortgage company get 's a way with it??? During the worst financial and health crisis our country has ever seen, while we are already struggling to keep a roof over our heads, our electricity on and food on our table, we are further victimized by our very own mortgage company causing us further undo financial duress. WHO PROTECTS US???? We just want our fee 's returned. That's is all. Nothing more and nothing less. It's the least they can do after what they've done. Lesson learned.

08/05/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"This complaint is about the loan modification process at Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. Please help me resolve this issue and obtain a final loan modification within 30 days. The problem began XX/XX/2020. Please note this date is after Pres. Trump disaster declaration due to COVID-19. 

My initial application for a loan modification was mailed on or about XX/XX/2020. 
Shellpoint requested that I complete a second ( 2nd ) modification application in XXXX. This second application was faxed on XX/XX/2020. Per a conversation with a Customer Service representative, my application for modification was approved on XX/XX/2020. As a consequence of an error made by Shellpoint the modification was subsequently cancelled on XX/XX/2020. 

On XX/XX/2020 I finally received written communication from Shellpoint stating, my account is seriously delinquent and in order to avoid foreclosure I needed to act by XX/XX/2020. I have spoken with customer service multiple times over the past 7 months and have made my monthly payments in the amount directed. 

Since XX/XX/2020 I have consistently made the monthly trial payments in the amounts requested. I have paid through XX/XX/2020. It is now XX/XX/2020 and my modification still has not been approved and I am being asked for additional trial payments some of which have already been paid. ( Specifically XX/XX/2020. ) I am now being threatened with foreclosure if I do not make another payment for XXXX. I can not afford to make double mortgage payments. 

It has been 7 months since the modification was approved. It has been 7 months I have made payments as requested and waited to receive paperwork.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",OK,None,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/05/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3779040

I do not know how Citibank could come to a conclusion that this was a quality of service issue given I did not receive any services. 

As with most construction jobs the up front money is for materials and the person receiving the service holds money until the job is complete and satisfied. 

My dispute was that I did not receive the materials that I was charged for and that were spelled out on the invoice. The invoice is clear the deposit is for materials.

Upon closing with my new bank, I paid my loan in full at US Bank and Mortgage. Nearly four weeks later, they sent me an escrow check with my remaining escrow balance. However, on the balance I noticed they retained approximately {$240.00} to pay mortgage insurance! Why would they keep {$240.00} to pay mortgage insurance on a mortgage that I have just paid off. More troubling, is that this was done with no explanation whatsoever. I had to comb oover my statement to uncover the discrepancy. 

Upon calling US Bank, they informed me that I am paying for previous months and because I paid closed on XX/XX/XXXX, I am required to pay for the entire month of XXXX. This makes no sense, particularly where my mortgage insurance was not paid from my Escrow account on the first or 2nd of the month.

08/11/20,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I am currently under a modification with Allied Servicing Co. I have attached a copy of the modification agreement, which I clearly signed under desperation in order to avoid being homeless. It is important to note that this agreement was only reach through forced foreclosure court proceedings as Allied Servicing refused to work with me initially.

Part of the agreement was for me to be able to refinance my 1st and 2nd mortgage prior to XX/XX/2020, which I was unable to do within the year due to my credit score. Then, Covid happened. The agreement states that unless I refinance before XX/XX/2020, I will have to pay the full amount owed ( approximately $ XXXXXXXX  ). I obviously do not have $ XXXX to pay out in a lump sum. 

I did not have any issues with my first mortgage company ( XXXX XXXX ) granting me a deferment for my mortgage payments nor with any of my other creditor. Once again, Allied Servicing is refusing to work with me and are demanding that I show proof of denial for refinance from three different lenders. As we all know, not all applications with mortgage lenders are subject to soft inquires, so I have had hits on my credit as a result of applying. 

This is not the first time Allied Servicing Co. has refused to work with me without forcing me into legal proceedings. Such legal proceedings have clearly added to my debt as they have unreasonably tagged on legal fees as well as other fees. I don't understand how forcing anyone into additional legal proceedings which lead to unreasonable fees is helpful to someone struggling with finances. 

I clearly do not have $ XXXX to pay off this second mortgage with Allied Servicing Co. by next month. I do not have any other means of income other than my employment. I am not asking for a deferment. I am simply asking for an extension of my modification for at least 6 more months so that I can refinance accordingly. My payments have been on time as per the agreement. 

I find the request of Allied Servicing Co. to be unreasonable and discriminatory, especially during this difficult time. Looking at my history with Allied Servicing Co., I believe their actions are due to the fact that I am am a woman of XX/XX/XXXX.

Even after I opened a new account the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX continued for a few months wile I figured out I wasn't getting it. 

The problem was identity theft on my mother-in-laws account. She was having trouble a was calling on a regular basis, she even asked for a new card and was told no by USAA employee, this happened for months. USAA then came after my account. After the neglect handling of her account examples : not giving her a new card ; declining to give a new card ; not doing anything about a recurring charge from the same place for the same amount over and over ; not escalating accounts ; saying they are putting notes in the file and nobody can find. 

For what ever reason they closed her account but still continued to take this charge over and over after being told it wasn't legitimate charges. USAA then started to take everything from my account plus anything comming in, all of my direct deposits,. 

USAA has done nothing to fix this. I have called numerous times and have talked to the executive resolution team just told me they will escalate my account after months of waiting why wasn't that done already. The response was the other account was escalated. In other words I'm getting the run around. 

The people involved are my mother- in-law, my wife, me, USAA and the thief. This is hard for me to type out and I'm sure I'm missing a lot of information so get back to me.

07/29/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I opened a new checking account with Suntrust for the specific purpose of transferring funds from XXXX, the selling app, where I sell face masks that I sew myself. Since the pandemic I have donated over XXXX masks to Nurses and first responders, I sell masks to cover my expenses. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my first deposit was made, and between XXXX XXXX deposits were made into the suntrust account. 1 deposit of {$50.00} was from my checking account with another bank, which I used to open the account. The other 13 deposits were from XXXX. When my funds cleared from a sale on the app, I immediately transferred the funds. 

In total, I have {$500.00} in the Suntrust checking account. 

For 10 days I was unable to access the account online, it prompted me to reset my password multiple times. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a welcome letter from Suntrust with checks for my account. I have not received any other communication from Suntrust. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Suntrust for help with accessing my online account. They told me my account was being closed for suspected fraud due to an investigation and report from another past banking institution that I used years prior. They told me my funds were being held for a minimum of 30 days. 

I told them this was unacceptable. I am very upset. I need this money to recover my expenses from sewing face masks and pay my daycare provider on Monday for the upcoming month. They allowed me to open an account and had no communication in the 9 days my account was open regarding this issue or investigation. All I have done is deposit money from the Selling app from the sale of face masks. 

After escalating to a supervisor he gave me an address in TN where I could mail a complaint. They were no help. 

My issue is that they could have easily seen an issue in my past banking history ( 2+ years prior ) when approving me for an account. There is no money owed to any banking institution. Instead, they allowed me to open an account and make $ XXXX deposits in a 9 day period with no communication on a potential issue. I had to seek them out to get an answer on how to access my funds and am now am being told I have to wait at least 30 days to access my funds. 

I havent done anything wrong and will be unable to pay my daycare provider on Monday which means I will have no care for my child and will be unable to go to work. 

I want my money ASAP as I am being punished by a bank for their own oversight.

08/04/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I was charged multiple late fees and interest charges to my Citi Cards account during the time that COVID-19 caused disruptions to businesses and to lives around the world! 

This matter began in XX/XX/2020 when I received a call from a Citi Cards representative stating that I missed a payment. I informed the representative that I did not recall using the card referenced and requested additional information on the charges so I could validate they were legitimate charges. The representative informed me that he was unable to see details but would transfer me to customer service who could assist me, which he immediately transferred me but a representative NEVER answered and the call and then I was disconnected. I tried calling several times thereafter ( days and weeks later ) and collection representative called me but customer service was not available, not even through the online chat portal. 

I eventually spoke with a professional representative who was extremely helpful in providing details of the charges, which was all I needed to pay the bill. In addition, he offered to credit late charges due to credit/payment history and the inconvenience but all of his attempts to credit the charges failed. The representative explained that the system would not allow him to apply the credit because my account was closed. I placed many calls after that call to have the late fees removed and resolve the delinquency but continuously experienced the same outcome, even with a supervisor. 

I paid the bill minus late charges. I was, and continue to be, in utter disbelief that during the time of a world-wide pandemic ( COVID-19 ), a company could be so insensitive to close a consumers account and continue assessing late fees knowing that CITI offices were closed, or operating on limited scheduling, reduced staffing, or whatever the reason may have been for not servicing customers! 

I had great credit prior to this matter, but Citi Cards has tarnished my credit and continues to do so monthly.

I wrote a complaint to multiple executives of the Citi Cards team and was told that charges would not be reversed because the payment was late - without acknowledging their lack of service to customers in previous months.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,191XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3777824
